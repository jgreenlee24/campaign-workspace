**Introduction**

Players arrive at the beautiful city of Zilspar, a massive gothic fortress surrounding the Deep Mine. The Mine separates the dwarven banking district from the gnomish seafaring district. The second level of the Deep Mine are many merchant shops, bars and brawling circles. The third level of the Deep Mine (the "Lower District") lies the prisoner's district, where prisoner's earn short rests as they fulfill their duties or restore their honor in managed combat. The final depths of the mine fill with the obnoxious noise of continous drilling and hand-to-pick mining. Streamlined fog hangs above the mine. The players take refuge from a storm.

The tavern they stay the night at, "The Stinkhole", is filled with smoke. In the corner, Mozart von Ludwig Vehtohven plays simple classic bar singalongs on a small, rustic grand piano and then bursts into unparalled musicianship with an array of compositions from jazz to classical. The crowd throws many coins his way, yet the coins seem to only be copper and silver (odd for such a wealthy district). The barkeeper complains about the lack of coin from customers the last few days.

Notable NPCs (at the Stinkhole):

- Paddy Everdale, the half-elf artificer (female)
- Dorg. it's just Dorg. the half-orc bounty hunter
- Glint Rockentur, the rock gnome engineer (forge cleric / artificer)
- William Cooper, the mysterious man of many talents (artificer / rogue / bard)

In the marketplace, a shifter murders an innocent looking shopkeeper (Laura Eldest) howling "For the Forsaken!" before seeming to shift into more wolf-like appearance. Guards immediately attempt to restrain and behead the creatures and tell the party, "Stay back. We'll handle things from here." The guards will gladly allow

The previous grandmaster Timekeeper (known as the "Grandfather" Valdir Melfast & wife Sierra) is dying of heart failure. Desiring to indefinitely cherish his last moments with his youthful wife, he sets up a time loop (also called a "weak" time delay as opposed to the stronger action of actually traveling in time), centered in the mountains where he takes his wife for a romantic getaway.

**Riak Mansion** 

Kalphan Riak is an example of Khorvaire’s new breed of nobility. Riak made his fortune in the arms trade during the Last War, putting his business savvy and his innate magical ability together to make enormous profit through sometimes unscrupulous deals. His tremendous wealth has earned him a mansion in the Upper District of the City of Kundarak, with open pavilions, sprawling quarters, and even a small garden growing on the towertop. Riak has investments throughout the city and controlling interests in six of Sharn’s ten banks. Perhaps more importantly, he is a member of the Aurum’s Platinum Concord, and conspires with his fellow Aurum members to ensure maximum profitability for their business ventures while inserting their fingers into every possible aspect of commerce in Sharn and greater Breland.

The Annual Peace Party between the House of Kundarak and the House of Sivis is about to take place (party begins around 5pm in the evening).

Optional Encounters:

- Morty the Mortician ("Please! Please! No more bodies! We can't take anymore..")
- Real-estate Agent (selling Laura's house)
- Forsaken Encounter

**CLockwork Dungeon:**

- Halls are dwarven brass and gnomish steampunk; a broken droid lies off to the side. A wire trap releases a single clockwork pest (7HP, AC 14, +5 to hit, DC12 CON save or 2d4 poison damage).
- Room with brass button and an hourglass on a swivel in the middle. The opposite door is closed. When the button is pressed, two zealots and two clockwork spiders drop from the ceiling and immediately attack the players. The players have 30 seconds (6 rounds of initiative) to make it out of the room. If the sentient constructs and spiders are defeated in time, the door opens when time runs out.
- Hall, acid trap (tile triggered on step, notifies adventurer). Perception check to notice tiny holes in the ceiling (20ft moving forward). 2d6 acid damage. Followed by a second repeated trap 20ft ahead.
- A large pendulum (DC 15 Athletics) swings back forth over a large pit (50ft = 5d6). Large horizontally rotating gears decor the walls providing another way across (DC 15 Acrobatics). One gear breaks for the heaviest player (DC 15 STR).
- Clockwork Locusts room. Locusts buzz throughout the entire room. In intervals of 6 seconds, they traverse the room at impossible speeds. The room is circular (300ft radius). DEX save (2d6 piercing (or half) + 2d4 poison). The poison builds up in the body per failure :
    - numbness (disadvantage) > repeated poison damage (1d4) - 3 rounds >
    - unconscious (1 minute) > paralyzed (1 hour)
- Glass room shaped like a funnel (bottom half of an hourglass) partially filled with quick sand, gradually filling the room. On half-full (30ft), the room rotates (DC 15 STR / DEX). The exit (large metal door) is in the other half of the hourglass, thus the party has to be taken by the quicksand into the other side. The glass itself only can full one side up to half-full (30 minutes). The room has an elevated stone slab surrounding the sand which provides temporary safety for the party upon entry.
- Boss room - Two chronomancers guarding the Warhammer of Time.
    - They only attack players within 50ft of the device.
    - The Warhammer is surprisingly inactive, a successful Arcana check (DC 15) shows this. IF the players choose to activate it, a successful Investigation check (DC 15) reveals a hand grip on the weapon's shaft which  activates the weapon's time-turner.

        probably

When the party leaves / time is reset, they will be disappointed the dungeon was fruitless. They have their options (such as going to the Lower District). On the way there, they pass by the ring again where Fred and George (chronomancer interns) are having fun messing with the fight. When asked about the dungeon failure, they will escort the party back to the Chronomancer's Hideout where they will meet Harry, the current Grandmaster. Harry will inform the group about the Last War and note that there are many more weapons like the Warhammer sealed away in the vault, deep underground. Thus, the party may want to do a bank heist. Harry charges Fred and George to assist the party's adventure. Fred notes "we need somebody on the inside..". Enter Jenkins, Leeroy and Physkicks. Experts, or so they say, at infiltration.

The amount of trade between the various nations and dragonmarked houses is so great, merely shipping gold coins back and forth between all of the involved parties at any given time would require more ships than even House Lyrander could provide, and would slow the Lightning Rail to a crawl from the weight of treasure they would have to carry. Enter House Kundarak, who’s trustworthy name and impartiality at running the largest banking system Eberron has ever known. Through it’s issuance of letters of credit, and its ability to honor such letters of almost any size on demand has made modern living possible, and has made the dwarven house quite rich in the process. The guild regulates commerce in gem cutting, jewelry manufacture, money changing and money lending. It also advises national governments about coinage.

If you are an Artificer of House Kundarak, you are an expert at building security devices, from simple alarms that can be placed on doors, to the vast impenetrable vaults surrounded by the most lethal traps imaginable that hold hordes of gold, silver, and platinum beyond the dreams of even the most greedy of dragons.

Keep in mind that from House Kundarak's view, the best defense is a good offense. They don't blithely wait for attacks on their vaults; they have their own network of informants who monitor underworld scuttlebutt. When they catch wind of a planned raid on one of their vaults, they (or someone they hire, like assassins from House Phiarlan or Thuranni) come down on the raiders like a ton o' bricks, before the raid when possible.

**Bank Heist**

"We are talking forbiddance effects all over the place, surrounded on all sides by lead plating protected on all sides by guards with see invisibility and some people with true seeing for good measure, patrolling earth elementals (probably lots of archers with true strike too). Teams of casters cast divination every day to find a hint of a chance of trouble in the next week, however due to the time loop, they've been suffering from severe headaches, migranes, and misreadings." ~ Jenkins

**The Lower District**

The bank is partially underground, scaffolding deep into the Deep Mines alongside mining camps. Four towers, each with 20 archers with true/blind sight monitor the traffic. Rail systems hang and shift (even float), abiding within area. Beggars gather below the railways hoping for coin to fall. The rails go underground once more leading to spacious underground areas varying in levels of security.

3 ways of entry (as proposed by Jenkins):

1. Entry via impersonating another wealthy individual (see Challenges section).
2. Entry via prison riot
3. Entry via sewage system

Challenges :

1. Convince the goblins you are retrieving an item at another vault. Produce a false key. Perhaps pickpocket a key or convince another patron to hand their key over. "Do you have your paperwork in order?"
    1. Requires: identification, certification of vault ownership, and a key.
    2. One certain dwarf if present, Dilva Regallia, a noble owning a mansion just away from the city.
2. The goblin opens a large pressured door and takes the party through the bank via the railsystem. An old, ugly gnome (wizard) sits on a chair reading a newspaper and commands the dog not to attack. "Sit", he says begrudgingly.The following door (pressured, steel plate + arcane lock + alarm - the goblin dispels the alarm) leads to a large chasm. Hovering, moving stone staircases form a unified, spiraling staircase going down into the darkness. Above (200ft) is a glass sphere shedding minimal light into the chasm. The Lightning Rail has a station on a tower connected to the building, a large steel door just below the sphere. The heavy breathing (almost snoring) sounds of a large beast echo through the chasm. The chasm was excavated in the original mining expedition which gained Kundarak a large fortune of wondrous gems and metals.
    1. Within the chasm, just above the player's entry point, a hovering landmass upon which several desks and bookshelves abide and move around. Three heavily cloaked Spell Sovereigns furiously read through books as the books pass through. One of them is in a trance. "Above us, you see the Spell Sovereigns, the most powerful mages, sorcerers and wizards in Eberron. Among them is Head Divination Wizard Amuk Amaryl, Lord Lareth 'ir Morgrave (founder of Morgrave University in Sharn) and of course, Sovereign of Law and Lore, Aureon (founder of the Esoteric Order).
3. The staircases leads to a hallway underground once more which eventually leads to the chosen vault. The vault that actually desired by the party is in an opposite hall (on the opposite side of the chasm).
    1. George / Fred casts "Path" which shows a phantasmal, misty lightblue-ish stream which leads to the the targeted vault (back to the open chasm which must be crossed by the party).
    2. Security is surprisingly minimal in this section of the banking system, probably because it is rarely ventured into, save those who represent wealthy individuals. Each vault has a faint magical circular in front of it (Per / Arcana 18) (see ) as well as an Arcane Lock and Alarm spell. - 6d6 fire

**Conclusion**

Late at night, the players arrive at the house of the previous Grandmaster of the Time. The Chronomancer will be inside his house in the woods inside a grandfather clock performing a ritual. Players hear a soft voice saying "tick tock ... tick tock"... They enter to see the old man surround by fairies and glistening feylights. A dark, feint blue light illuminates the room.
