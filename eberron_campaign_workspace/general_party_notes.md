- Character Overview
    - Snorri’s parents died in the Mourning, he inherited a large fortune
    - Born in Thaliost when it was owned by Aundair, moved later on to Mror Holds.
    - Spent several years in Droam on behalf of House Kundarak, where he fell into the worship of the Fury, and had an affair with a Harpy.
    - Came back from Droam more driven by his passions then ever before, which caused difficulty in his marriage. Both Snorri and his wife agreed to seek space, though not divorce.
    - Snorri managed to get a job as a traveling enforcer. He receives messages from the Ghorad'din to settle insults directed towards their house. These range from verbal insults to minor theft, and occasionally something larger.
- Backstory

    The local elf children and wannabe-elf children teased Snorri, leading to many fist fights. His father told Snorri he had to learn to take it in stride, but Snorri refused, believing any insult needed to be met with his fist. His dragonmark tattoo appeared at a young age. When the Great War broke out, Snorri's family was recalled to the Mror Hold, where he spent most of his childhood reeling in patriotism as the dwarves declared their independence. When Snorri was of age, he was selected to work for House Kundarak in the Warding Guild, where they decided to send him back to Aundair. In Aundair, Snorri came across an elf hoping to use the guild service to store large amounts of his families wealth. Snorri recognized the elf as being one of the children that teased him, so he broke the elfs jaw, declared their feud over, and agreed to his contract. Realizing Snorri wouldn't work out, he was recalled to the Mror Holds, for proper training in etiquette. While in his "training", Snorri fell in love with, and married, Udaena Mroranon, and fathered two children, Reibal and Undon. His training ended when his teacher, frustrated at Snorri's lack of progress, insinuated that Snorri's beard looked like a giant's pubes, resulting in Snorri beating him up. Snorri was put on trial, but as the insult was real, and Snorri had the dragonmark, he was only given a warning. Snorri resigned and left to join as a mercenary for Thrane. He spent several years fighting for Thrane, and took part in the campaign that captured Thaliost. During the sack, he made sure the houses of all of his childhood enemies were burned. Missing his family, and considering his vengeance against the childhood bullies complete, Snorri returned to the Mror Holds, living off his captured plunder. Eventually, his father's constant prodding about contributing to the House made Snorri resolve to try again to find a place for himself in House Kundarak. He spent several years travelling through the warring kingdoms with his father, learning the trade, but Snorri still found insults towards his people and himself, resulting in grudges and fights. Realizing he could only be changed so much, his father sent him to Droam to try and set up a contract to open a new branch, figuring his behavior would be a boon to the mission. While in Droam, Snorri realized he felt more at home with the monster races, who embraced their passions, than he did with the Kundarak. He began to partake in their Revels and fell in love with a female Harpy named Jalira Stormtongue, a member of the flayer guard in Graywall. He abandoned his worship of the Sovereign (Doldorn) and became a devotee of the Fury. Eventually, his mission in Droaam failed, as the Hags did not trust the dwarves. Snorri was forced to leave his harpy mistress and the Revels, and return to the Mror Holds, where his devotion to the Fury had to remain a secret. When he arrived, he found out his parents were in Cyre, and had been slain during the day of Mourning. Snorri took it very hard, as he had no one he could blame and lash out at. His wife, Udaena, realized Snorri had changed. Snorri eventually came clean to his wife about Droaam, his embracing of the Fury, and his affair with Jalira. Around the time the Great War ended, Snorri and Udaena decided to separate, though not divorce. Snorri managed to make a deal with the Ghorad'din. Though Snorri did not have the subterfuge to join their ranks, there were cases that needed a more open approach, and were hardly worth the Ghorad'din's time. Snorri would take these cases, and beat the shit out of the people that had wronged House Kundarak. They gave Snorri a magic book, "The Book of Minor Grudges", so he could keep track of all of the insults. Snorri crossed out the word minor, and using what he learned in Droaam, began writing the new contracts in his own blood, each letter a private prayer to the Fury that his vengeance would be dealt. Over the last few years, the book has been primarily filled with Snorri's personal grudges, though he still seeks out the House contracts and fulfills them. Most require a simple kick in the teeth, a few are of actual note and require the use of his axe.

- Ghorad’din - [House Kundarak's](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Kundarak) own intelligence service of assassins and spies, very little is known about this guild beyond the walls of House Kundarak. Ghorad'din's leaders are unknown however, what is known is that they take orders directly from [Lord Morikkan](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Morikkan_d%27Kundarak) and his six hereditary chieftains. The one thing that all other secret services envy and fear of Ghorad'din is that by using the teachings provided by Kundarak they have become experts at bypassing security, even Kundarak security.

**Elazra** (Eladrin Bard, 5’ 6’’, 115 lbs, 380 years old)

- Family (Third child of 4 daughters):
    - Father was an explorer. He still explores to this day and is quite successful, but is looking for his lost daughter as well as seeing the world.
    - Mother was a paladin. She fought bravely in the last war but was greatly injured, and is no longer able to fight as she once did.
    - Oldest sister is a rogue. She has been missing for many years after going on the run from the law, and it has been almost a hundred years since anyone has last heard of her.
    - Second oldest sister is a farmer. She has settled into life in Eberon and uses her natural eladrin magic to grow great crops, and is especially noted for her squash.
    - Youngest sister is an academic. She has done much research on what occurred during the final battle of the last war when the feywild was cutoff, searching for a way to go home, and though she did not discover the answer to this, she made many other successful advancements in her fields and is well regarded among her community as a fine scholar.
- Childhood:
    - Born in my home
    - Raised by mother and father
    - Had a poor lifestyle and no home
    - Had several friends and a generally happy childhood.
    - I helped my family make ends meet by playing music on the streets, and became well skilled in my
    - When I picked up my musical instruments, I discovered that I could already play them.
- Life Events:
    - I was charmed by a spell: while out playing in the forest as a young child, I came across four shimmering lights and followed them. They led me into a deep grove far from where we traveled before, but it was a forbidden grove that we were told to never enter, were the twilight sun never shone. From the pool of black water, a watery tendril rose out, shining in four colors, yellow, green, blue, and red. They swirled amongst each other as the tendril reached out and touched me in the forehead. I awoke lying on the ground in the forest, the grove no longer anywhere to be seen. After this occurrence, I lost the ability to control my emotional state as other Eladrin do, and now am split among four personalities every time I awake.
    - I was poisoned by a trap while adventuring, but recovered. In one of my headstrong states as a child in my thirties, I set off to explore a mysterious stone tower which appeared in the forest. However, upon walking in, a poisoned dart shot out planted itself into my left ankle. I could no longer proceed forward, and collapsed on the floor. I was found lying in the empty field were the tower once was later. After weeks of agony, I recovered from the poison. However, no matter my seasonal state, my left ankle and foot remain black and without feeling to this day, though I can still move it normally.
    - As I grew older, I joined in a battle of the last war, originally as a bannerman. However, in a headstrong in summer form, I took up the call to battle one day and joined in. We were victorious, but many friends were lost. The next day, in my winter form, I mourned and ran away from the feywild to the prime material world.
    - The interplanar travel between the material worlds was cutoff at the end of the last war. I lost my home and connections to many friends and family I once knew, and have been living in the Eberron ever since. Due to the war, my family was also on this side, except for my eldest sister, who has been lost to us for the last few hundred years.
    - Exploring this world away from my kind, I branched out and explored many lovers over the years. The first significant one was a neutral human monk, who was intrigued by the apparent state of chaos of my personality. However, while he we got along in my other forms, it was my spring one which constantly annoyed him with my upbeat and cheery state, which clashed too much in his calm demeanor. The final straw of this was during the time I was staying at his monastery on a visit. During this time, through events that we don’t need to go into, led to the local wildlife of the isolated region to devastate the sacred texts of the monastery’s library in an effort to use them to clean it up. After this, he was furious and I ran. Apparently, I am now a great enemy to him and his monastery, many of whom even wish me dead.
    - My next serious relationship was a neutral evil half orc academic. Like the monk before, she was intrigued by my strange personality and wanted to study the magical charm which put me in this place. However, we quickly grew close. Despite her selfishness, we got along rather well. We enjoyed butting heads while I was in my summer state. We enjoyed running strange experiments while I was in my Spring state. We got into moral debates while I was in my Fall state, but grew strong in love despite this and began to joke about evil vs. good. And I enjoyed the abuse she gave me while I was in my winter state, while she enjoyed the chance to exercise her sadistic nature. I eventually felt the need to travel on from her college, feeling the need to go with the flow of the world, and we left on this understanding, knowing that we could resume where we left off should we ever become reunited.
    - My next serious relationship was much more short lived. He was a neutral human warlock who had a patron with some great old power. He was emotionless, and may have sought to feel through me. However, it turned out he was much more into his patron than myself. He would often try to get my blood, needing fey blood for his rights. He even got some of it, not always with my consent. However, he became obsessed with just me, and refused to use the blood of other fey creatures. I got too creeped out and left. However, he took this very personally, and still hunts me to this day to get the blood he needs for his studies and to right the perceived wrong I’ve done by leaving him.
    - The last serious relationship I was in was with a neutral half-orc barbarian. He enjoyed when I played quick songs that he could swing an axe to in battle. We got along fine, but he hated the weakness I showed when I was in a winter form. One day in this state I sought comfort with his brother, not realizing he was not as open in his relationships as I was. When he found out, he took it upon himself to kill his brother and try to kill me. I escaped, but believe he may still be pissed off and hunting me to this day.

    TLDR;

    - I’ve played music since I was a child. I play in different styles depending on my current emotional state, but always enjoy to play a good song. I never stay in the same place for long, and like to wander. I also am a sucker for a pretty face, and enjoy connecting with new people wherever I go, which has led to more enemies than friendships in my past. However, I have missed the feywild where I’m from, and am always eager for a chance to once again find it.

Syndra

- Backstory

    Syndra was born the youngest daughter of 3 to Kaixis and Tavoros Brineth in the depths of the Feywilds. Her older sisters, twins Riviryn and Irevyre, were constantly on her ass growing up. The two were inseparable and her parents doted on them constantly leaving Syndra feeling quite alone and isolated most of her childhood. She didn't make friends well, often driving them away with childish antics or shunning them in a bout of Winter depression. When the Feywild started to disappear, Syndra found herself separated from her already distant family, somehow left in one of the villages that remained with Eberron. She was still young, only 97 or so, but able to hold her own mostly. Now finding herself with no ties, no home, and no way to support herself, she ended up making her way to Fairhaven in search of work. On her first day in Fairhaven, she was approached by a young Elven man by the name of Algos Cualtinu who offered her a place to stay for the night. Being in Autumn form at the time, she accepted his kind offer, and soon found herself a guest at his manor. Unfortunately, she found herself in less that accommodating surroundings as she ended up chained in his back room. She remained captive by him for 180 years, offered little freedom and abused in many ways, before she found an opening one day when he was feeling generous and left her uncuffed for a few moments while he answered the door. He had assumed by this point she was completely compliant, and she mostly was, but he caught her on a Summer day and though her mind had broken, she was wild at heart and still took her chance at freedom. Escaping to the streets of Fairhaven in barely any clothing, she broke into a nearby shop and managed to find more suitable attire. Mustering every last bit of her charisma, which was nearly nonexistent not to mention being a little fucked in the head due to her time in captivity, she found her way into archery training, soon becoming more than proficient with a longbow and finding her 'calling' of sorts as an Urban Bounty Hunter when she discovered the bounty on the head of an elf named Algos Cualtinu. He was her first successful bounty and the thrill of capturing him was enough to have her hooked to such a trade. Though not charismatic in any way, she was very good at infiltrating various and finding her quarries through pure persistence and her looks. Oddly she was often written off as unassuming, and not very intimidating. Plus, the fact that her appearance and mood seemed to change daily made it easy to catch people off guard, though it also made her memorable as there weren't many Eladrin in Fairhaven. It wasn't until a few years after her escape that she even learned of the Last War, having spent the entirety secluded from the outside world. It was in pursuit of a rather lucrative quarry, a rather rich goblin by the name of Falrirx Edsok, that she found herself in the tavern on the night of the portal opening, and it is only her own intrigue and lust for adventure that finds her accompanying the party elsewhere, and perhaps she'll run into her quarry along the way somewhere.

**GENERAL NOTES**

[Dragonmarks](General%20Party%20Notes%207932f4cb6d9e4b14b95d2605a31a371d/Dragonmarks%20b9f9f84ac721400baa165d5dea8975f3.csv)

**ELADRIN LANDS.** Although a few communities of eladrin are
native to Eberron, most who live the world are inhabitants or former
inhabitants of the feyspires. The names and locations of the feyspires are as
follows.

- **Shae Tirias Tolai**, in the center of Xen’drik, was called the City of Silver and Bone. It was the feyspire that could be called the birthplace of the elven race. Its ruins still sit in the deep jungle. his haunted ruin has stood empty since it was pillaged during the Age of Giants.
- **Pylas Pyria**l, in Zilargo (between Korranberg and Trolanport in the Shimmerwood Forest) is called the Gate of Joy. Its population includes a majority of Feywild-native gnomes, and has a cordial relationship with the Zil triumvirate.
- **Shae Joridal,** in the center of Darguun, is called the City of Emerald Lights. It is constantly under siege by the goblin military.
- **Shae Lora Lyndar**, in the Twilight Demesne of the Eldeen Reaches, is called the City of Rose and Thorn. Although on fair terms with the local druidic clans (especially the Greensingers), it is still wary of being permanently tied to the Material Plane.
- **Shaelas Tiraleth**, in the south of the Mournland, was called the Court of the Silver Tree. Explorers who venture into the Mournland have not yet explored the part of the Mournland near Valenar’s border to see how the Mourning has effected the feyspire.
- **Taer Lian Doresh**, in the Whitepine Forest in the mainland of the Lhazaar Principalities, is called the Fortress of Fading Dreams. Its citizens are still adapting to the Principalities’ pirate society. Despite disturbing stories of nightmarish creatures roaming the woods, and strange sleepwalking communities, the feyspire is on civil terms with High Prince Rygar.
- **Taer Syraen**, near the Scions Sound in Karrnwood in Karrn, is called the Winter Citadel. It has a contentious relationship with the Karrnathi government, but a close one with House Phiarlan.

Other manifest zone
ideas:

- **Whisper Rock.** People have always shunned this dark forest. In the past a few local lords have sought to cut it down, but none have succeeded. Some say the trees won’t burn, and that they bleed when cut. All that is for certain is that there is a path that runs through it, and those who stay on the path are safe… but those who leave it are often never seen again. Walking the path you may hear lovely voices calling to you, or beautiful music. But if you value your life and those you love, never leave the path. *Whisper Rock shows the influence of Thelanis, but the last few sentences suggest the idea of a gateway. It doesn’t always happen, but if you hear the music and follow it you will find yourself in Thelanis – and this is why many of those who leave the path truly never return. Beyond this, the wood is home to a few dryads that don’t like people, some enhanced predators, and a few other lesser fey.* [http://eberron.wikia.com/wiki/Whisper_Rock](http://eberron.wikia.com/wiki/Whisper_Rock)
- **The Tomb of the Forgotten King.** In the Mror Holds, the old miners tell a story of the Tomb of the Forgotten King. It varies from telling to telling, but core details remain the same. It cannot be found by those who seek it out; instead, it is found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in a ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, there are guardians patrolling the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others there are deadly traps. But one detail remains the same throughout all the tales: treasures taken from the tomb always bring misfortune, curses that linger until the thief finds the tomb again and returns what they have stolen… or until the robber dies. In one story the explorer finds the casket of the king himself, and from it takes the *Final Blade*, whose wounds cannot be healed. He uses it to settle a feud with a rival clan… only to die when he stumbles and cuts his own wrist with the blade. His daughter returned the blade to the tomb, and it has never been seen again. *Here we have a beachhead – a piece of Thelanis that comes and goes. It’s also a dwarven tale, so the fey in this tomb will be spirits of stone and steel. Adventurers could stumble upon this by accident, only to have a dwarven PC recognize it from the tales. Will they seek out the Final Blade?*
- **The Grove of Promises**. There is a fountain in a nearby forest. No one knows who built it, but its water is clear and pure and it has never run dry. Local stories say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain that you must keep your word – that if you are false, you will sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove… will you? *This is an example of influence. Breaking a vow made on the fountain will afflict the liar with a disease; it can be survived, but it won’t be pleasant. It’s possible that there is actually a fey tied to the fountain who judges such things and can make the punishment more or less severe; and during a coterminous phase, that fey might even be able to manifest and leave the fountain.*

**Fey Courts (Key Factions of the Fey):**

- **The Coral Court**, a large but reclusive group of Archfey who preside over the waters of the Feywild. Merfolk, fish-fairies, and the other denizens of the sea follow their rule. They are perhaps the most numerous of all the Archfey, but they keep to themselves, rarely interacting with the surface. The Coral Court is led by Elias and Siobhan Alastai, the Sea Lords, two children with power over all the oceans.
- **The Green Fey**, the (second) most plentiful and variable of the Archfey. The Green Fey represent all aspects of nature, primarily its plants and animals. They are wild and independent, sometimes even ferocious and bestial. They have no one leader.
- **The Gloaming Fey**, a band of Archfey who roam the night and play with the stuff of dreams — inconstant, changeable things, like love and shadows. They bow to no one leader, but their most prominent member is Oberon, King of Shadows, most known for his tryst with Titania.
- **The Summer Court**, an alliance of Archfey who promote light and life, and seek to protect good fey and mortals alike. Although their mission is the most friendly to mortals, they are still not especially welcoming, and they have been known to use questionable methods to protect those under their dominion. They are led by Titania, the Summer Queen, a benevolent but sometimes cold and frightening ruler.
- **The Winter Court**, a small collection of Archfey who reside in the Feywild’s wintry wastes. The members of the Winter Court follow either the Prince of Frost, a melancholy Archfey who commands ice and snow, or the Hearth Maiden, who keeps fey and mortals warm against the bitter cold.
