# Scenario 3b: First to Fall

**Chase Scene:**

Players roll iniative at the start of play. This will serve as a pseudo-iniative throughout the chase scene when order is necessary, otherwise the players have free actions. For each "round", players describe how they want their characters to contribute. A DC is set and must be met. For each failure, the complication count is incremented. At a certain threshold, a complication occurs (see the complication table below for details). Complications includes traps, hazards and short encounters. Using a timer could help drive faster decision making.

The mission will begin as a stealth encounter. Players escort a group of scientists through a warforged construction sector. Each station (section) is monitored by 1 "looker" unit. These warforged patrol and monitor, have embedded alarm systems and are accustomed to a Hive Mind network that links their generation, passing along messages regarding intrusions and threats to their posts. Example unit names follow the format: L-123.

TODO: include warforged schematics / designs (refactors) based off the Gatewars era. These schematics detail an evolution of design, iterative developments on various model series. This is important for the developing the perfect host subplot.  Warforged are being actively de-commissioned ("disconnecting" from the Hive Mind). Android designs are proposed, warforged mould gradually appear to reshaped to more realistic human shapes. Notably this "black out" does not affect newer models of warforged - this is a means to de-comissioning older, outdated models ("products"). This "de-commissioning" serves two purposes: 1) preserving the reputation of House Cannith, 2) recalling Quori spirits for creating the "reforged", a model series "designed" to retain previous *instrumental* memories, that is, a means of skill retention for passing along to the next generation of forged units.

### Section F. Construction and Deployment

As one escape strategy, the players have the option of exiting through a warforged assembly line. Inoperable warforged are actively being constructed by menial laborers and pass between various stages of inspection. The final warforged products stand in line to the Black Terminus awaiting shipment directions.

(1) **Metal-heating Corridor**

A series of copper-colored metal plates lines the walls of the path before you. 

The plates are 6 feet high and 6 feet wide, and cannot be damaged or removed. They produce an invisible electrical field that extends from floor to ceiling throughout the 70-foot-long corridor. The field isn't directly harmful, but metal objects that pass between the plates become heated. Metal will become uncomfortably warm after moving 20 feet into the field, painfully hot after 30 feet, and hot enough to deal fire damage at 40 feet and beyond. The field affects armor, weapons, equipment, and even treasure made of metal. A character in metal armor who tries to move through this corridor would take damage as follows: 4 (1d8) fire damage at 40 feet, another 9 (2d8) fire damage at 50 feet, an additional 16 (3d10) fire damage at 60 feet, and another 22 (4d10) fire damage at 70 feet. 

Characters not wearing metal armor but carrying metal weapons or equipment will feel only slight discomfort when passing between the plates. Metal carried in wrappings of cloth will burn through by the 50-foot mark, and it will similarly burn through leather by the 60-foot mark. Armored characters might have no recourse other than to remove their armor, then drag, push, or use magic to get their metal armor and weapons through the corridor, and then suit up again. Armor pulled through the corridor by ropes will heat up enough to burn through the ropes at 60 feet, leaving a pile of hot metal lying in the water. The only sovereign remedies for this dilemma are area effects that deal cold damage, such as ice storm or cone of cold, which will nullify the effect long enough for the party to dash through.

(1a) ***Smelting Moulds***

The moulds for each of a Warforged's parts are cast in stone and metal. The moulds heat and cool with the flux of the forge's subterranean magma tides. At high tide they grow hot enough to quickly smelt ore, the impurities separated by the electromagnetic fields. The impurities can then be skimmed from the surface of the mould. As the magma tide rolls out, the remaining metal cools—casting the pieces for assembly.

(2) ***Piston Assembly***
Defilers move on six piston-like legs. Here the cooled metal is finished, and the heavy armour plating welded into place. Row after row of the giant, bladed appendages form a metal forest for the Horakhs to hide in. Called "machine-beasts", these mechanical insectiod creatures resemble large cave crickets. This beast wraps its victim in spiny legs and claws when it attacks. A horakh’s black, chitinous thorax is topped by a translucent digestive sac—often containing half-digested eyeballs of varying sizes, colors, and species.

- **Encounter:** 3 Horakh (ToB) - CR 9 (*3)

Hermana Aurelia d'Cannith

A dwarven overseer spots the players as they exit the Piston Assembly room and alerts the L-series officers ("Intruders escaping through Sector X5-F, requesting backup.")

(2a) *The Mines*

This massive chamber is filled with the deafening hum and roar of machinery. Piles of rough rock ore are spread throughout the area, around which a prisoner work gang toils in the sweltering heat. Smooth metallic columns rise to the ceiling, with open hatches set into their sides at ground level. Haggard prisoners frantically shovel ore into these hatches, which pulse with a deep-red glow.

(2b) *Prison Cells*

This area is lined with boxlike metal cells, all built of the same strange materials seen elsewhere in the mechanical mausoleum. Most of the cells are empty, but shouts and a sound of creatures hammering on locked doors are heard from a few.

(2c) *Worker Convoy*

Convoy lines of warforged tinker various construct parts into vaguely humanoid shapes.

(2d) ***Spinning Cylinder***

The stone corridor changes abruptly to a spinning cylinder, apparently made of some light-colored metal. The inner surface rotates rapidly. It is painted in a dizzying black-and-white spiral pattern, and it glistens as if coated with some substance. This cylindrical grinder is used to shape the round edges of a warforged's armor. The cylinder appears to be partially apparent in this room, however extends through a wall to an adjacent room, likely where the rotation mechanism functions.

The 30-foot-long cylinder is 10 feet in diameter and spins counterclockwise at about 10 feet per second. The inner surface is covered with slippery oil. It is possible to slide through the cylinder by propelling oneself along the floor, but walking through this area without being knocked prone requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The cylinder serves two functions: (1) to coat the warforged in oil before a sudden ignite, (2) to add curviture to the forged armour design. The "ignition" flame spikes upon any bypass, a simple Kundarak rechargable *glyph of warding* (explosive rune). When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. The Sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage on a failed DEX saving throw (DC 16), or half as much damage on a successful one.

- DC 16 Perception Check:
    - You notice on the opposite end of the cylinder, a small, pulsating flame originates from a ground-level metal grating.

***Actuator Production***
Here, menials machine the hundreds of small moving parts that make up a Defiler. Each part must be strong enough to endure the thrashings of a bound daemon, yet perfectly shaped and calibrated so the war machine performs optimally. Because of the intense amount of manual labour needed to produce these parts, this location is crowded with menials.

## Continuation

- **Dolghasts -** This humanoid is messily bisected by a division of boiling flesh running from the tip of its skull down its face, chest, and groin. It is as though one creature had been formed from two halves - one living and one dead. The line where the two meet churns with liquefying flesh, as unholy life constantly fights against necrosis, giving rise to a ghastly smell. The living half is hunched and emaciated, while the dead half is partially skeletal and rotted.

***Reaper Autocannon Production***
The Reaper autocannon is manufactured here, beginning with smaller, lava-heated moulds all the way through the final finishing and fire-testing. Unfortunately each finished gun can only be tested on a special trigger assembly, which does not pivot. Unless the Battle-Brothers are kind enough to stand right in front of the guns, the auto-cannons pose little threat to them.

- **Encounter:** Machina Daemonium (CR 15)

***FLOOD DOORS*** 

The three doors along the corridor are made of thick metal, their edges flanged so that they overlap the door jamb on the north side and thus can be opened only by pivoting them to the north. The north side of each door has a handle so that it can be pulled open from that direction. These barriers are emergency doors, whose purpose is to prevent the dungeon from being flooded by the boiling lake at area 15, in case of an "accident." 

***BOILING LAKE*** 

A bubbling lake reaches down to the red-hot rock depths below. Warforged appear to be treading water at a shallow end on the other side. The lake appears to run-off through a channel to the east.

This boiling lake is several hundred feet deep, extending down to the red-hot rock below, and reaching nearly to the ceiling of the cavern it occupies, 50 feet above the level of the sunken ledge described in area 17. It is fed by an underground stream that enters from the northwest at a depth 100 feet below that of the ledge. Its run-off flows through a channel to the east, above the ledge, near the ceiling of the cavern. 

Any creature that enters the boiling lake takes 4d10 fire damage immediately and again at the start of each of its turns for as long as it remains in the lake. 

***BLOW HOLE*** 

The run-off from the boiling lake cascades down through a series of near-vertical lava chutes to the base of the blow hole, 800 feet below the level of the dungeon. There the water strikes molten rock and is instantly converted to steam. It is ejected up the blow hole and out the top of the volcanic cone, forming the continuous geyser. The boiling water here is just as dangerous as the water in area 15. 

***THE BOILING BUBBLE*** 

A sunken stone ledge projects out into the boiling lake. The corridor from the dungeon continues out into the · ake under a magical force field that keeps out the water by forming a sort of elastic skin. The shape of the corridor is not square in cross-section, but rather semicircular, as if a series of hoops were supporting the ceiling. The protective skin is soft, resilient, and uncomfortably warm to the touch. Under any pressure it immediately becomes taut, and any character unwise enough to puncture it with a piercing weapon will cause a stream of scalding water to rush into the corridor, hopefully burning the idiot who made the hole for 1d4 fire damage). Thereafter, any creature that enters the space with this stream of scalding water or that starts its turn there takes that damage. The skin will not "heal" once it is compromised. Major damage to the skin, as from a slash with a sword or an axe, will collapse the field like a deflating balloon in ld6 rounds. After 30 feet the corridor gives way to an oval-shaped, domed area enclosed by the protective skin. 

Encounter: Giant Crab

A character who grabs Wave while the protective skin is collapsing can save the lives of those nearby by using the trident as a cube of force. Wave will instantly make its bearer aware of this property and allow the bearer to instantly become attuned to it if that person worships a god of the sea or is willing to convert on the spot. Characters protected by the cube will probably end up being blown out the geyser at the top of the mountain. The air-filled cube will float, drain down the cascade, and be ejected from the mines - a rocky ride. Characters could also survive the boiling lake with a combination of immunity to fire damage and the ability to breathe water.

***POOL AND DRAIN***

As the characters move along the water-covered corrior, they can see that the water is deeper in a small cirular area to the east. This space is a 10-foot-deep pit. At e bottom is a wheel connected to a valve. Turning the wheel requires a successful DC 20 Strength check.
When the wheel is turned, a channel will open, and all the water in the wet corridors will drain out in 1 hour.
Also at the bottom of the pit is a secret door that is concealed by illusion magic. The door cannot be detected by sight, but can be discovered through the use of magic or by someone who examines the area by touch and suceeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***GEYSERS AND CHAINS***

 The door opens onto a stone platform in a large natural cave. Opposite the entrance in the distance is another stone platform. Between them, a series of metal disks are suspended from the ceiling at escalating heights by massive steel chains. 

The cave floor seems to be covered by a pool of boiling mud. The ceiling is 50 feet above the level of the platforms. The cave floor is 50 feet below. Two spots in the mud are the locations of geysers. The northern one erupts once every 5 minutes, the southern one every 3 minutes. The stone platform opposite the entrance is approximately 90 feet away. The disks are about 4 feet in diameter and 3 feet apart. Each disk is attached to its chain fixed in its center. The disks swing freely and will tilt when weight is placed upon them. The disks and the chains, as well as the walls of the cavern, are covered with a wet, slippery algal scum. This coating gives off a feeble phosphorescent glow. 

Climbing the chains or the walls requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. When the geysers erupt, they reach nearly to the roof of the cavern, and creatures holding onto the disks or the chains might be washed off to fall into the boiling mud. The damage a creature takes from a geyser depends on how close a creature is to the geyser when it erupts (see the table below). Creatures that succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw take half damage. In addition, a creature that is on a disk or holding onto a chain when a geyser erupts must succeed on a Strength saving throw (see the table for DCs) or be knocked off and fall into the boiling mud. Location Damage DC Adjacent to geyser 27 (SdlO) fire damage 14 One disk away 22 (4dl0) fire damage 13 Two disks away 16 (3dl0) fire damage 12 Three disks away 11 (2dl0) fire damage 11 Four disks away 5 (ldlO) fire damage 10 Anywhere else in the area 3 (ld6) fire damage Any creature that falls into the boiling mud takes 44 (8d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns for as long as it remains in the mud.

You spot the phalanx of machine-like beasts several dozen metres out. The heavy brutes are neither quiet nor agile as they lumber over the jagged terrain. It is as though someone took the most deformed mutants they could find, and then covered them with crude augmetics and corroded armour plating. Over time, the foul essence of the creatures beneath have warped the machines as well as the flesh.
