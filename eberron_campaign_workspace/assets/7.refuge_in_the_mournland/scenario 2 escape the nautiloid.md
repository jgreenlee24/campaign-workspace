### Part 1: **Into the Sewers**

---

(1) Entry: *Below cascades a vertical, brick-lined tunnel leading into darkness. Rough iron rungs line one side of the access, proving a means of descent. The slow serration of sewer sludge is audible from below, and the unmistakable smell of sewage wafts up from the tunnel’s darkened depths*. 

- 3-foot circular stone slab covers the sewer access (thieve’s tools / Strength DC 15).

(2) Junction Chamber: *Several drainage tunnels come together here in a 20ft-by-20ft chamber of slimy brick and vitrified clay. The water in this chamber is about 3ft deep and contains ubiquitous floating matter that gives off a questionable, stomach-turning stench.**

- *Sewer Fever* - Pathogenic organisms thrive in this unsanitary area. CON save 12 vs. poisoned (loss of 1 point of Constitution every hour until cured).

(3) Outlet: *Light shines down from a 3ft diameter shaft in the ceiling as the tunnel suddenly ends. Metal rungs in the far wall provide access up the shaft*.

(4) Gas Pocket: *The tunnel ends in a 20ft diameter domed chamber filled with 2ft of rank water. The unpleasant odor redolent throughout the tunnels seem stronger here.*

Intelligence Check (DC 12) - The gas is methane. Success indicates that the PCs identify the methane early enough to halt the rest of the party from entering the gas pocket. Open flames (torches, etc.) cause the methane to explosively ignite, dealing 3d6 fire damage to all creatures within 30ft of the chamber (DEX 15 for half damage).

(DC 12 Investigation) Beside a long-aged, scorched skeletal corpse of a past Cyran soldier hiding from the war rest some equipment: *feather token*, *flametounge shortsword .*

**Treasure:** A chipped *feather stone* and a sword are near the body; the sword is stylized with flame wreaths writhing up and down each side of the blade, the cross-guard looks like a fireball reaching down into the hilt. Upon swinging, as you coil back in the backswing, sparks emit out around the cross-guard; it then ignites and smokes out as you finish the swing.

- *Flametongue short-sword* - 40ft radius bright light, 40ft dim; +2d6 fire damage

(5) Inhabited Pipe Junction

*The sewer water is waist deep here, but it gradually thickens into a semi-liquid sludge in the 20ft chamber ahead. Several conduits and pipes lead off this junction, and the nauseating smell of refuse hangs heavy in the air.*

The sludge reaches a depth of 8ft in the center, though it is only 4ft at the edges.

    - Environment Effects
        - Difficult terrain. CON 12 save or 1 level of exhaustion.
        - Attacks in the deeper sludge (except piercing) are at disadvantage.
        - The creatures have 3/4 cover unless otherwise exposed (+5 AC).

(6) Flumph Cloister: *Part of the wall of this sewage pipe appears singed and corroded, weakened over-time. Whilst making your way through a gigantic empty cavern, a strange green glow illuminates the vaulted ceiling, picking out a whole landscape of stalactites. As the glow increases, you are able to pick what looks like tiny floating jellyfish moving toward each other. They begin to spiral, as if in a flirtatious dance. Slowly they align themselves vertically, forming a column which begins a long, careful descent to the floor of the cave*.

**Section A. Cattle Deck**

(1) Entry to Section A. (via sewer system)

*The air in the tunnel is warm and laden with moisture. The still humidity smells unpleasant. A resinous, sickly violet mucous coats the walls of this tunnel. Whorls and striations visible in the coating give rise to vague feelings of nausea. The floor of the sewage system is covered in clear, ankle-deep water; the water smells faintly of salt. Here and there, small tadpole-like creatures swim unconcernedly in the warm liquid.*

(2) Tadpole Feeding Stations

*Several empty glass jars lay strewn about this chamber, half submerged in the ver-present briny fluid covering the floor. The tadpole-like creatures swimming through the water seem thicker here. Along the curve of the northeastern wall, a large wooden trough sits slowly rotting from its contact with the water. A wide-headed mallet hangs from a metal hook in the wall to one side of the trough, a gastly smell of death wafting up from within it. An alien metal door hooks into the feeding bay rimmed by an extraterrestrial substance which is the composition of the walls.*

Within the trough, the contents of brain-meal (prepared by emptying the contents of the glass jars into the trough and using a wooden mallet) sits ready for the growing illithid tadpoles.

(3) Urophion Sentry: *The areas keyed to this chamber appear no diferent than any of the other sections of the cavern - though an odd stalagmite juts-up from the center of the cavern*. In reality, the stalagmite is a urophion* standing diligent sentry duty. The urophion is a genetic blend between an illiquid and a roper, combining the most lethal attributes of both subterranean races. Because the urophion actively adjusts its body temperature to that of its surroundings, it is undetectable using standard vision.

    - Description

        (DC 20 Nature) *Urophions are one of the most successful outcomes from the illithid genetic experimentation programmes. A cross between mind flayers and ropers, these black monstrosities combine the physical powers of ropers with the intelligence and psionic power of the illithids to create a fearsome guard dog. For indeed, illithid society considers these half-breeds unfit for anything more than guard duty; a crushingly dull life for creatures as intelligent as urophions.*

(4) Thrall Chamber

*The chamber ahead is higher than the previous tunnels and free from the ubiquitous briny fluid covering the rest of the cavern floors. An alien metal door can be discovered ahead, evidenced by the spongelike flooring showing imprints of human feet turning in the direction of the room. The following chamber is dreadfully chilled, a cold storage room for the thralls. Scratched upon the far wall are the words, “We live for the New Masters.”*

Like all illithids, the mind flayers psychologically desire to dominate thralls. Unfortunately, the temporary nature of the Cyst and its rude, wet accommodations make it difficult for humans and demihumans to prosper. In spite of the poor conditions, the thralls once housed in this chamber probably would have survived if their masters hand’t given in to their hunger. The chamber is otherwise empty. Various Khalashtaar bodies lie on pristine white beds covered in sheets. Their body glisten with a cool liquid covering; their skins are, consequently, entirely white. These humanoids have undergone the completion of surgical procedures, becoming successfully infected by a controlled Devil’s Spine parasite, numbed by consumable anesthetics injected into their skins. The bodies show signs of life (breathing, pulse, etc.) however they have no personal thoughts. Lassha’atai, a relative of K’atai, is one of these bodies. Zellix’Phor will attempt to override any telepathic conversation that occur in this room or and at any other point throughout the rest of the lair (DC 18 Insight, see Elder Brain Regional Effects).

*The tunnel walls press close, slippery with frozen condensation. Hardened resinous layers on the walls, ceiling, and even the floor suggest oozing swells of gray matter, ganglionic tendrils, and tentacles. Only seconds later, a tremendous noise, as of splintering rock and snapping struts, erupts from the earth. A fissure of darkness breaks to the surface, disgorging a rain of rock, the sound of twisting metallic struts, chunks of alien flesh, and a plume of dust.*

(4b) Transformation Chamber

*Crumbled stones and rents in the earth give way to an artificial space below the earth-a spherical chamber with half-collapsed, chipped, and powdered walls. Organic pods line the perimeter, tight-fitting in the compact space of the room. A regular passage curves off to the southeast, but the most interesting feature of the chamber is the humanoidshaped depression carved into the nadir of the chamber. Within the depression lies a desiccated mind flayer, somehow preserved against complete rot and decay.*

Player characters who take the time to observe the form notice that the creature’s head is attenuated and swept back, forming a visage even more feral and terrifying than that of a normal mind flayer. Also, discerning heroes may note that the tentacles Seem much longer than a standard mind flayer’s. These are characteristics of alhoons, though these pods seemed to have resulted in birth defects. Within the other pods are Githyanki, their conscious states questionable. A single Khalashtaar is encased in one of these pods. A resonance stone near each pod emits a calming effect (effectively *calm person*, used for the vital function of provided newly ceramorphosed mind flayers feeling of reassurance and contentment).

(5) The Aquifer

*Searching this 100-foot-by-100-foot area uncovers a suspiciously wide fissure leading downward. The fissure is between 3 and 5 feet wide at its narrowest, and it zigzags down some 40 feet eventually upward the surface of stagnant water. An antigravity affect keeps the water in place. The fissure obviously continues down below the waterline, but there is no light, sound, or noise to provide a clue as to the tunnel’s ultimate destination. Here and there, small tadpole-like creatures swim leisurely in the cold brine.*

(INT 15) This entire complex once served as an aquifer for the ship. Following the impact and subsequent decay of its quintessence coating, some of the area’s water drained out though most of the water remains trapped within.

There is a horizontal elevator connection this section to the next, allowing the players the possibility of bypassing this section assuming they have access to a psionic key. Two air pockets are available the first course of 40ft providing breathable air for the first two Medium sized creatures. If the tadpole-like creatures are agitated by the PC's presence, they unify in a singular swarm to attack the assaulting player. Use the stats of a Swarm of Cranium Rats, given a swim speed of 30ft and water-breathing.

- PCs must swim to access most of the areas in this fragment.

The following quick rules appear here for ease of reference:

- PCs can hold their breath for an amount of minutes equal to their Constitution scores rounded up. DMs should halve this number again (rounding up) if the PCs exert themselves (encumbered PCs are always exerting themselves).
- If a PC wishes to hold his breath past his normal allowance, he must make a successful Constitution check. This check receives a cumulative -2 penalty for each subsequent check after the first. Failure indicates that the PC must breathe; if still underwater, he drowns. PCs with the Swimming proficiency can move underwater at a rate equal to K their land movement rates.
- Non-proficient, unencumbered PCs move at their land movement rate, and encumbered non-proficient (or unconscious) PCs sink 40 feet per round.
- Over the course of the combat, PCs will make two Athletics checks (DC 15) to avoid taking a level of exhaustion.

The two areas marked with an 18 are spherical chambers bounded by black meteoric rock. Each of the rooms is completely filled with cold brackish water. PCs who enter the water for more than 2 turns must make successful saving throws vs. paralyzation or become paralyzed as the heat leaches from their body. If this happens, encumbered characters, or PCs wearing metal armor sink to the bottom of the area (30 feet down) and drown once their air runs out

Water does not completely fill this spherical area, which measures some 40 to 50 feet in diameter. Thus, swimmers can find a breath of air when surfacing in this area. Unfortunately, there is only enough air in this chamber to provide a Medium sized organism with two hours of air. The more adventurers who enter into this area, as well as area 21 and area 22, the faster they use up the breathable air. The DM should keep careful track of the amount of time spent within these areas. For every round the PCs thrash around in this area, there is a 5% cumulative chance that the water weird in area 20 investigates the disturbance.

The entity responsible for clean water is not dead, as its elemental nature allows it to nourish itself through a tenuous link to the Elemental Plane of Water. In the intervening years since the original explorers released this fragment back into time, the creature has kept the water in the aquifer sparkling clean and clear. Unfortunately for the PCs, this specially created water weird regards any and all swimmers as contaminants of the first order, and it moves to cleanse its domain of the new taint.

The weird immediately attacks anyone who enters into this area, but it also moves throughout the entire fragment to eradicate contaminates as necessary. Explorers who retreat at least 10 feet up into area 21 or area 22 are safe from the water weird’s attacks. However, anyone close to the water’s edge in these areas risks being pulled in by a serpentine column of water.

The water weird receives a +4 bonus to its attack rolls against any creature already in the water. Any PC who can breathe water through magical (or other) means is safe from a water weird’s drowning attack. PCs who rely on simply holding their breath while in the water must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation to avoid immediate drowning, as the creature forces elemental water past the victim’s lips. Even more deadly, the creature is nearly invisible to any already in the water; thus, swimming PCs roll at disadvantage when fighting the water weird.

Notes: Any creature struck by an elder water weird must make a Constitution save vs. paralyzation. Failure indicates that the weird pulls the creature into or under the water (those already under water are caught in the grip of the weird). Each round in the grip of a weird requires a victim to make another save to avoid drowning. If a creature is drowning, they are considered unconscious and must make death saving throws.

### Part 2: **Section B. The Research Bay**

Cleansing Chambers, Guardsroom, Transformation (Sleeping) Chamber, Prison, Tadpole Chamber, Library/Dissection Chamber, Escape Shaft, Resting Pool

(1) The Flayer Gallery

*Impinging on your mind are images of pain: bone splinters, shredding skin, broken legs, and the loss of friends. Blood, brine, and the familiar taint of death pollute the area. The chamber itself is shaped like a bowl filled with shallow water. The ceiling of the room contains many small concave depressions, all of which are damp. Bits of broken rock and shattered resinous sculpture cover the area, and large portions of the wall have split open. Thrusted into the stalagmites on the ceiling above, several humanoid bodies are impaled, clinging to the earth, inert and broken. In a brine-filled basin below, three figures limply splash about in the chamber’s central shallow pool. Two of which appear to be acting in fear, limping towards the remaining two exits of the room.*

This circular gallery, rising some 50 feet to a domed ceiling, once held several warm pools in which dozens of illithids lounged in comfort, waiting out the future in a timeless instant. However, these mind flayers did not count on coming out of stasis upside down. When this chamber reentered the timestream upside down, the briny water pool, the servitor thralls, and every illithid in the gallery fell 50 feet. Most of the inhabitants of this fragment were killed instantly, but some feebly hold onto life, gasping in pain and surprise at the sudden (from their perspective) change of orientation.

Although the chamber once held 24 illithids, the broken and inverted lounge now shelters only 4 living, but severely wounded, illithids. Their recent trauma has completely unhinged 1 of the illithids, and it is madly struggling against its peers-though none of the creatures are functioning at an optimum level. The player characters have 2d4 rounds to catch the illithids unawares. If the PCs make contact, the creatures react fearfully and assume (rightfully) that the heroes are responsible for their predicament. At that point, three of the illithids-Shagath, Naip, and Conarfen-attempt to escape via their psychoportive powers, while the maddened mind flayer (Mulseth) attacks the player characters indiscriminately. If any of the illithids flee to the Astral Plane, they may return later (at the DMs option) to trouble the player characters at an inopportune time! On the other hand, they may flee and never return. Once the PCs deal with the wounded illithids, they can search the shattered chamber. For the most part, all of the chamber’s psionic items, sculpture, and other items of value have shattered. However, the PCs can collect a total of 421 crystal coins (3 gp value each) at a rate of 20 per.turn. In addition, a search reveals a striator, a bone ring, and a psionic bracelet. on paper. The bone ring grants the wearer the ability to adhere to surfaces once per day as if using the spider climb spell at the 10th level of magic use. Finally, the bracelet allows the wearer to utilize the effects of a passwall spell (cast at the 10th level of magic use) three times per day. Abbreviated Combat Summary (Illithids): Shagath, Naip, Conarfen, and Mulseth have an AC of 5 and possess 4,10,8, and 17 hit points respectively. Because the illithids are so wounded, the DM should award only 3,500 XP for their defeat.

(1b) Teleportation Station

*Glyphs and sigils arranged in patterns of unnatural geometry dot the metal surfaces of this chamber. Pulsing lights of myriad colours create a circle on the floor of this dome. A glass panel hangs on one of the walls.*

*Planar Portal.* A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check understands the glyphs can be used to teleport. If the check succeeds by 10 or more, they learn the movements and words necessary to activate it, which takes an action. When activated, a gate spell appears in the centre of the dome, linked to the Fractured Hand on the Astral Plane (see “Astral Retreat”). A failed attempt results in hallucinations of hideous cityscapes of unnatural structures whose angles are wrong, and requires the creature to succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or develop a form of short-term madness (see “Madness” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

(2) Illithid Chambers (Quarters)

*The area ahead is higher than most of the other tunnels, free of the stagnant briny fluid. Purplish resin, however, streaks these tunnels. In fact, it appears that some thought was put into shaping the ectoplasm before it dried as the mucous forms crude furniture. Three indentations filled with moss hang on the east wall of the chamber. At the foot of each indentation sits a pair of two-lobed boots. Above the pads, a resinous rod supports several cloth garments on metal hooks. In the center of the chamber, three rough shaped chairs surround a circular platform 2ft high. Many sheaves of striated parchments lie in neat stacks upon the central “desk”.*

(3a) Aides’ Chambers

The two chambers keyed to this entry resemble room 5. Only one illithid inhabits each of these chambers. Unless the creatures hear sounds of conflict from other chambers, they sit calmly writing reports and working on timetables for the supposed “Dawning of a New Age” (Draconic Prophecy). If the illithid occupying these rooms hear the party, they immediately teleport to room 5b and warn of the invasion.

(3b) Elder Brain Resting Pool

*This large area is dimly lit by the faintest of crimson illumination spilling over the edges of a central pool some 30 feet in diameter. While dust, crumbled rock, and other debris cover most of the floor, the pool itself seems relatively clear of fallen masonry. However, PCs who look closely at the pool can see a large mass of some indeterminate object floating just below the surface. Thrusting up from the southernmost portion of the pool is a thin iron rod, topped by a crystal container. A small lump of brain tissue lies within the container. In the centre of the chamber is a broad pool filled with effervescing purple fluid, covered by a glass dome. The walls are made of an oozing metal-stone hybrid and lead to a circular hole in the ceiling giving access to the cavern above.*

*Pool.* The glass protecting the pool has AC 20; 50 hit points; and immunity to nonmagical damage. The glass allows telepathy and psychic damage to pass through, otherwise serving as full cover. The fluid restores 10 hit points to any creature submerged in it on initiative 20 each round.

*Divination.* Zellix’Phor, the elder brain of this sojourner colony, has a permanent arcane eye in this chamber. If it detects intruders, the elder brain comes to attack itself or sends minions from surrounding areas. (Elder Brain, CR 14).

(4) Dissection Chamber

*The stained metal floor of this chamber slopes down to a drain, above which floats an edged metal tray. Glass pods on the walls contain gruesome medical implements.*

*Creatures.* Two *mind flayers* are dissecting the corpse of a female child on the metal tray. They are distracted, reducing their passive Wisdom (Perception) score to 11. There is a potential escape route through this room via the drain. This leads to 6a. **The child can be saved.** She is currently in a state of stasis, though the medical instruments have opened her skull, neck and exposed the top of her spinal column. A successful Medicine check can save her, though this takes time (10 minutes, DC 20). A failed check results in her dying, though her body can be preserved via a *gentle repose* spell or *spare the dying*. If the latter is cast, a Medicine check will be required to stop her from bleeding out and she will need to be carried carefully unto safety. *Banishment* or storing the body in a timeless space (such as in a *bag of holding*) can prolong the body in this stasis state.

The doors can be sealed via an *arcane lock* spell or an extra-dimensional space (*tiny hut, rope trick*, *plane shifting* to the Astral Plane) could give the party additional time to afford the initial Medicine check to save the child.

(5a) Decomposition / Reagent Dissolution (Waste) Chamber

*Warm, humid air clings to the ceiling, obscuring this domed chamber in fog. Pipes running up the walls sporadically puff cloud of acrid smelling effluvia into the air*. *Discarded brain matter and entrails fill the bottom of the chamber. A familiar warm liquid fills the rest of the room, leaking from the pipes above. Foul-smelling fluids spatter the sloping floor of this dome. Chunks of fleshy substance have gathered around the depressed drain in its centre. Along the dome’s edge are frosted glass doors.*

Mind flayers present aboard the ship:

- Zobulex
- Cephalossk
- Aurangaul
- Quoor
- Drusiss
- Shagath, Naip, and Conarfen (wounded)
- Musseth (maddened)

### **Escaping the Nautiloid**

- **Encounter (CR 8-14):**
    - **Mind Flayer Psion** Medium Aberration **CR: 8 XP:3900**
    - **Mind Flayer Arcanist** Medium Aberration **CR: 8 XP:3900**
    - **Elder Brain** Large Aberration **CR: 14 XP:11500**
    - **Mindwitness** Large Aberration **CR: 5 XP:1800**
    - **Ulitharid** Large Aberration **CR: 9 XP:**

This should be a group effort involving various skill checks. Roll initiative for the sake of order tracking, though the party interactions can bypass this order. Ask each player, how do you want to contribute?

Obstacles / Difficulties:

- The thralls - mindless agents of the Inspired, Khalashtaar induced into a permanent dream state though their bodies are in full control of the Inspired. They will attempt to grapple the players, though their strength has been greatly limited due to fatigue from surgical procedures. They work together to grapple 2 players. (DC 12 Acrobatics or Athletics).
    - Alternatively, the parasites could emerge from the bodies to attack the players (see stats for Proto-Shoggoth).

Here are some suggestions for contributions:

- Investigating rooms / other parts of the ship.

### Miscellaneous Ideas

---

*For an instant, the very fabric of space seems to warp - distances stretching to infinity close to nothing, straight lines warp and wave, and vertigo assaults your senses. In the eye of this psionic storm, space opens up, and a blue pool of thick blue slime oozes out onto the ground. As your vertigo subsides, a tall wormlike creature rises up from the pool. Its translucent skin reveals strands of pulsing organs beneath it, and a ring of hooked tentacle like limbs surround a gaping lamprey like mouth*. *It has seven eyes scattered across its pale body, and blue-green veins are visible underneath its rubbery skin.*

The warp of space is a side effect of an alien *summon monster* spell cast by “The Blessed”, who lurks on an overlooking roof. In the first round of combat, he casts *summon monster* again to spawn a second wyste into the slime pool. He uses *boots of climbing* to descend the opposite side of the building, planning for this to be the intruders’ deaths.
