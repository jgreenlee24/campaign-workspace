Making has become a city of gang-violence and illegal operations.

Outside of the all-protective enclosures built to house the miners, Making is little more than a hellish wasteland. Even before its great hive spires and the fires of industry blackened the sky, Making was never a hospitable home. Its surface is harsh and largely devoid of water, and its atmosphere is only technically breathable before the fires of human industry poured countless pollutants into the air. The mineral resources beneath its surface, however, were reason enough for the Cannith to claim Making and condemn millions to toil in vast, cavernous mines, extracting ore and other valuable materials. In the long-forgotten corners of the city, hives of extraterrestrial creatures ferment and spawn. The depths of Making’s vast mines are still populated by hordes of enslaved warforged and Cyran refugees (wretchlings). The mines are no longer actively worked by anything more than a skeleton crew. The population centres are capable of producing a significant percentage of their own foodstuffs through fungal farming in long-depleted mineshafts and nutrient reclamation techniques.

As you arrive at a three-storey structure, its exterior plascrete and steel walls discoloured with centuries of grime, Oath-Captain Nils puts on a respirator mask and recommends doing the same, before pushing open the ruststreaked doors. The spacious chamber beyond is piled high with junk, and the ceiling sags in several places. Nine pools of congealed blood arrayed about the room and the fresh skin-burns and wand discharges scarring the wall speak to the recent violence. The air is thick with the smell of blood and an overpowering scent of decay.

**Don't forget, the Originator, a sentient prewar designed machination which deploys envoys on schedule. This is necessary for designing suitable hosts for the Inspired.**

**Ideas:**

**Factorum Mortuarius** *(see Dark Heresy, Gamemaster's Kit)*

(1) *Factorum Mortuarius -* a mortician / dead preparation centrum; could provide undead resources for Vol's army (a portion of which initially collected by the *Corpse Collectors* and stored in Atur's "cold storage"); the Mourning, thus, created an indefinite number of salvageable corpses for this purpose. The Emerald Claw serves as a puppet for the Inspired's ultimate plan for conquest.

Additionally, this factory is operated by warforged; thus those entering / exiting the mists of the Mourning are constructs and undead; the mists offer cover for the operation.

(4) The Bell Tower - The bell tower that stands in the middle of the university imparts a sense of architectural pride, a 125-foot tall tower of fine workmanship and elegant beauty. The duty of ringing the bells every 3 hours during the day has been carried out by members of a single family since the tower was build. A flickering light can be spotted from a window near the top of the tower.

(4a) Antechamber - The tower’s outer door is locked. *The door opens into an antechamber, with steep, narrow stairs leading up to the right and another heavy door straight ahead. Though the ceiling rises high above and another window pierces the wall above the door, all light is swallowed up in the dark granite walls and floor.* (Stealth Check, DC 15).

(4b) The Tower Keeper - An oil lamp flickering in the far right corner offers this room’s only illumination. It rests on a low book-case, beside a comfortable looking, if weathered, armchair. In the far left corner is a bed, carefully made, and a small nightstand. From a 5-foot square hole in the center of the ceiling, four heavy ropes dangle, coiling on the floor.

NPC: Turvin, an old shifter, stooped with age and gray-haired. (A wererat, retains his gray hair and gaunt frame). Turvin alerts his family upon the character’s arrival; a means to ensure his family’s protection.

(4c) Nests - *This small room is littered with debris and smells strongly of rodents waste and animal fur.* The four rooms that form this level of the tower are nearly identical. The majority of the wererats in town have used these rooms as a large common nest, sleeping together in a large pile in either rat or hybrid form. One wererat sleeps in rat form in the corner of the room (Perception Check, DC 15). The rat wakes up, climbs 20 ft straight up the wall, and squeaks loudly to alerts its companions.

- Stairway Trap (DC 18 DEX save) - A purposely dismantled plank, avoided by the wererats, provides a makeshift stairway to the next section of the tower. The landing (5ft) falls apart given excessive weight. (40ft fall - 4d6 bludgeoning damage).

(4c) Ropes and Pulleys - Four ropes descend from the ceiling into the room, one attached to each of the bells at the top of the tower. Before coming down here, each rope goes through a pulley in the roof of the tower and then snake from floor to ceiling, passing through a series of pulleys to distribute the weight of the bells around the structure of the building. Four sturdy wooden beams, 1 foot wide each, cross the room 20 feet above the ground, suspending the largest pulleys.

(4d) The Bells - *The stairs end abruptly, and a gust of wind blasts through this topmost level of the tower. Open archways afford a splendid view of the desecrated town below, as well as three carved grotesques (**gargoyles**) perched around the top of the tower. Overhead, four enormous bells hang in the peaked spire, each suspended in its own archway. This large room is crisscrossed with ropes and enormous pulleys, the machinery that allows a single person to ring the enormous bells above with a mere pull on a rope. The agitated squeaking of a rat echoes high above you.*
