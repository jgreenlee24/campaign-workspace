**The Five Wards of Korth**

Korth has five main wards: Highcourt, Temple, Commerce, Community, and the Low District.

The Highcourt Ward houses most of the government departments, as well as the halls of the royal family and some of the more affluent noble families. The Commerce Ward presents businesses of all types and provides space for the enclaves of all the dragonmarked houses; supply and demand come together inside this sprawling ward. The Community Ward is the most residential ward in Korth, providing housing for the middle class. The Low District is a dangerous maze of narrow streets from which the poor and the destitute attempt to err out an existence. The criminal element has a firm hold on the Low District, using its twisting warrens as a hiding place and somewhere from which to conduct business best done in the shadows. The riverside bluffs on which Korth was built provide natural borders between one district and the next.

***Tower of The Twelve***, full of classrooms, libraries, and laboratories devoted to arcane research, the arcane institute funded by the dragonmarked houses, has its permanent campus in Korth: thirteen-tier tower that floats above Wollvern Park (Community Ward). During the war, the Twelve tried to remain neutral but got as caught up in things as everyone else. Now, rebuilding and trying to restore a regular arcane curriculum, the Twelve competes with the Arcane Congress in Aundair for promising students.

***East/West Citadel***: two sprawling fortifications near Brink's Gate and Trade Gate. West Citadel abuts vast stables (House Vadalis compound) and serves principally as barracks for the nation's light calvary, a force some 200 strong. Roughly 400 infantry (halbadiers) dwell within the East Citadel. (male half-elf fighter 2/rogue2).

Storms roll across Scions Sound all year long, and particularly cold blasts can sweep in from Karrn Bay without warning. This climate has made the Karrns a hearty and robust people—somewhat dour, but with strong constitutions and a regimented mind-set. When the winter nights grow dark and cold, the typical Karrn enjoys a blazing fire, a hank of meat, a tankard or two (or more) of rich ale, and a large chunk of cheese.

***Other places in Karrnath***

[https://eberron-hok.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/important-sites-in-karrnath](https://eberron-hok.obsidianportal.com/wiki_pages/important-sites-in-karrnath)

***Rekkenmark*:** The Military Academy of Rekkenmark has trained Galifar officers for hundreds of years and continues to excel as the premier training facility in all of Khorvaire. Before the start of the Last War, nobles from each of the Five Nations sent their sons and daughters to Rekkenmark for at least part of their education. Karrnath hopes to once again welcome students from all over Khorvaire into the halls of Rekkenmark Academy, but in a war-weary world only a handful of students from outside the nation have so far applied for and been accepted into the facility since the war’s end.

***Lake Dark:*** The pitch-black waters of Lake Dark shimmer in the farmland in eastern Karrnath. Fed by the cold runoff of the Iron River, Lake Dark is a large body of mist-shrouded water that collects in a depression in the fields between the Icetop Mountains and the Talenta Plains. The small towns of Lakeside and Irontown flank Lake Dark, and smaller farming communities encircle it with their various kinds of crops. Many believe that spirits haunt Lake Dark, and that the pitch-black waters provide a pathway to Dolurrh, a location from which the living can sometimes speak with the dead. Lake Dark is a manifest zone connected to the realm of the dead, and spells related to necromancy have greater power when cast in proximity to its dark, restless waters.

**Grey Waters** is a Cabinet of Faces facade tavern. It resides away from the main roads of Atur and finding it required a DC 15 Gather Information check. Within Grey Waters, everything has been painted a bleak grey which would probably keep most customers away. It almost resembles an ocean within the ethereal. The place is run by a doppelganger who introduces himself as “Vaunn Ochem” when he is under the guise of the owner, a pale and slightly drooped middle-aged Karrnathi woman.

**Delilah and Sons** (tavern)

On Pit Passage, in a caravan quarter of crowded streets and exotic brothels. The street outside is filled with noxious smoke from a burning trash heap. The inn is a simple wooden shack, with a single salvaged stone wall and only a few crude tables and benches. A fake dragon's skull hangs over the hearth. Accommodations consist of a single large room with wooden cots and several hammocks in the common room.

Menu

- Nightwood Ale, made by Brinter Distillery (4 cp)
    - Nightwood Ale, has a strong flavor and cloudy color due to the top-fermenting yeasts used in brewing it combined with the bitter hops, which balance out the full-bodied, fruity flavor of the fermented yeast. Karrns refer to the beverage as *Nightwood Pale*, referring to its golden color, much paler to that of M'ror ales.
- Dried Pork and Millet Bread, Tankard of Perry (12 cp)
- Stewed Sausage and Wheat Bread, Tankard of Stout (10 cp)
- Boiled Pork and Watercress, Tankard of Beer (11 cp)
- Stewed Mutton and Artichoke, Tankard of Cider (11 cp)
- Roasted Trout and Barley Bread, Tankard of Beer (8 cp)
- Pottage, Mug of Stout (5 cp)
- Stewed Watercress, Mug of Stout (4 cp)
- Boiled Bear and Lentils, Tankard of Cider (11 cp)

- Tower : Warforged, He was a Brellish front-line warrior. "A Karnathy tradesman tells me that the Karrnath gov't has been working to crack down on the Emerald Claw." There are open recruitment drives for the Claw. There have been pretests against the government because ex-soldiers are having problems getting benefits.
- Cesa: Female Elf Aristocrat, Evil. Cesa is tall, with black hair and blue eyes. She wears fine raiment and jewelry

Kaltrop, warforged: *Hail, travelers. Take heed, for horrors dwell within this city of the dead. Champions of both the Silver Flame and the Red Watchers fall one by one with each journey into the darkness. I remain here to speak of the dangers awaiting you. Perhaps this knowledge will spare you from a dire fate.*

Points of Interest in Korth:

- Four entrances to the city: **Westgate** (the terminus of the road from Rekkenmark), **Northgate** (the terminus of the lightning rail), **Eastgate** (the terminus of the road from Karrlakton), and **Rivergate** (a customs house on the dock, rather than a gate per se)
- **Caves of the Skeletal Hands** - There are caves in the city that a bunch of Dhakaani goblins have moved into. At this point they have permission to live there but there's been an increase of goblin related crime at night and people suspect the goblins are trying to lay claim to more of the Community Ward.
- **Cannith 12** is a secret workshop site of House Cannith, specifically, Cannith East, which is governed by Zorlan d'Cannith from Korth, Karrnath. The workshop is in the far northeast of the nation of Karrnath, north of the Mror River and east of the Icewood. Cannith East seeks to create a new form of construct undead, animated with eldritch power and a bound ghostly intelligence. They have also taken up worshipping the Blood of Vol. Zorlan is a devout follower of the Blood of Vol.

# Vampire

*Medium undead (shapechanger), lawful evil*

***Armor Class** 16 (Natural Armor)*

- **Hit Points** 144 (17d8+68)
- **Speed** 30 ft.
- **STR** 18 (+4) **DEX** 18 (+4) **CON** 18 (+4)
- **INT** 17 (+3) **WIS** 15 (+2) **CHA** 18 (+4)
- **Saving Throws** Dex +9, Wis +7, Cha +9
- **Skills** Perception +7, Stealth +9
- **Damage Resistance** Necrotic; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing From Nonmagical Attacks
- **Senses** Darkvision 120 Ft., passive Perception 17
- **Languages** The Languages It Knew In Life
- **Challenge** 13 (10,000 XP)
- *Shapechanger*. If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.
- *Legendary Resistance (3/Day)*. If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- *Misty Escape*. When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.
- *Regeneration*. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.
- *Spider Climb*. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- *Vampire Weaknesses*. The vampire has the following flaws: Forbiddance. The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water. Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed. Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**ACTIONS**

*Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).* The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

- *Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).* *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18)
- *Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).* *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. *Hit:* (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus (3d6)necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control
- *Charm.* The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack. Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.
- *Children of the Night (1/Day).* The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

**Legendary ACTIONS**

Vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn.

- Move. The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- Unarmed Strike. The vampire makes one unarmed strike.
- Bite (Costs 2 Actions). The vampire makes one bite attack.

Bits of bone and strips of rotting flesh are caught on the creature's spiky carapace, as if it's been rolling around in a graveyard. Its fanged maw snaps at the air somewhat listlessly and the stink of carrion is overwhelming.*
