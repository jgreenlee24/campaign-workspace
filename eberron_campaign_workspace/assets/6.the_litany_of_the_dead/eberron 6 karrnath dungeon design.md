# Eberron 6: Karrnath Dungeon Design

**Karrnathi Undead Research Facility (Magic of Eberron pg.30) / Dungeon 167 - Heart of the Forbidden Forge & The Emerald Spire Superdungeon (The Automaton Forge) - Back Entry**

*The Automaton Forge* 

*The Sanctum Areas L5 through L8 constitute the Sanctum, where 15 automatons once provided amenities for Nhur Athemon’s guests. These constructs are designed for specific duties, with sufficient self-awareness to anticipate the needs of clients. The massage construct’s hands are imbued with soothing magic, while the cook can magically season, heat, and chill dishes. Time and wear are slowly whittling away at them— some have lost the use of limbs or specialized tools, and a few are defunct. The staff are identified by function and number; the active staff are Steward, Chef Two, Massage One, Beauty Two, and Servers Two, Four, and Five. If the PCs fight the servant automatons, use the emerald automaton statistics on page 154. However, each automaton has only 5 hit points, retreats rather than fighting back, and isn’t worth any XP. Unless an automaton’s head is destroyed, it remains conscious even if physically incapacitated.*

**Entering the Level** A long shaft leads down from this room. Thirty feet from the bottom of the shaft that leads to this area, the climb becomes challenging. The walls and the ladder’s rungs are coated in thick slime, and in one section the rungs have rusted away entirely.

Crossing this gap without falling requires a successful DC 15 Acrobatics or Athletics check or using rope and help from companions. The good news is that if anyone slips, there’s something to cushion the fall; the bad news is that it’s a gelatinous cube, as described in area L1.

Encounter: A Gelatinous Cube rests at the bottom of the ladder. Part of the cleansing facility.

**L1. The Cube** At the bottom of the shaft lies a chamber with walls formed from opaque green glass. Doors exit the chamber to the south and west. There are doors to the west and south, each made of green glass reinforced with rune-inscribed copper bands. There are no handles—just a handprint engraved into each door. Characters who succeed at a DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (engineering) check notice that the handprint matches an emerald automaton arm. If anyone falls from above, she takes falling damage and is immediately engulfed by the gelatinous cube at the bottom of the shaft; the cube takes a number of points of damage equal to half this falling damage. If no one falls, the first PC in the group attempts a Perception check (DC 20 due to the reflectivity of the hexglass walls) to spot the cube before descending into it and being automatically engulfed. An automaton hand opens the doors automatically. Otherwise, the doors can be opened with knock, a successful DC 18 Disable Device check, or force.

The Sanctum’s climate is controlled by magic that keeps the temperature pleasant and banishes dirt, moisture, and unpleasant odors, making it appear that the area had just been cleaned. Globes infused with continual flame provide bright light throughout the level. ****Most walls are formed from hexglass— the same material that makes up the surface ruins. Ceilings are 15 feet high throughout the Sanctum and 20 feet high throughout the complex.

**L2. Storeroom** This room is filled with crates and shelves loaded with supplies. The southern wall is lined with threadbare white towels. A cabinet on the western wall holds scores of green glass teacups, and a metal crate next to it is filled with small bags of faded yellow cloth. This room is filled with supplies that haven’t been touched in years. The yellow bags hold tea leaves so old they’re little more than brown powder. Nothing here is valuable.

**L3. Washroom** The door to this room is unlocked. A white marble basin in the corner appears to serve as a latrine. A mirror and a crystal orb are mounted on the wall across from it. The sphere on the wall is a cleansing orb that removes dirt, germs, and other filth from the user’s hair and skin. The marble latrine automatically eliminates organic waste placed within. Both draw power from the Spire, and if pried loose cease to function.

**L4. Arrival Hall** A narrow hall leads to a small foyer. Patterns of shadow, reminiscent of ripples on water, pass over the green glass walls. No light casts them—they seem to be illusions. The chamber surrounds a low platform engraved with a massive mystical pattern. A pair of double doors is set into the wall across from the platform. A scene engraved on the doors shows people relaxing in a pool of water. A successful DC 20 Knowledge (arcana) check reveals that the platform is an anchor point for teleportation magic. It is inactive and damaged. The double doors to the south aren’t locked, and swing open if a PC gets within 5 feet, revealing the Tearoom (area L5). Fixing the teleportation circle requires a character to first study the existing magic (detect magic is the simplest way), diagnose the trouble by succeeding at a DC 20 Arcana check, and finally jury-rig the teleportation circle with a successful DC 20 Arcana check. If activated, the teleportation circle can be used by any creature that moves onto the platform and remains there for 1 full round. It teleports characters standing on it to the corresponding pad in area L6.

**L5. Tearoom** The engraved double doors swing open, revealing a cozy room. The couch by the crackling fire is richly upholstered, and a massive painting hung above the fireplace depicts a wizard battling a dragon. There is a small door to the north, and a large double door to the west. Place settings are laid out at a round table. The table holds a curious centerpiece: a bodiless metal head with crystalline eyes. When the doors open, the eyes of the metal head light up. “Welcome, honored guests,” it says in a creaky voice. “We have long awaited your return. Server Two! Guests for tea.” The automaton head is all that remains of Steward, the leader of the servant constructs. He seeks to engage the PCs in conversation and persuade them that they are in no danger. In a short time, another construct (Server Two) arrives. The door to the west soon opens, and a dilapidated old automaton shuffles in. It has a thin build, one of its eyes has fallen out, and parts of its armor plating are missing. It carries a steaming kettle and a tea service, but comes to a stop and stares. In a buzzing voice, it says, “C-c-could it b-bbe? Have the P-P-Patrons returned?” If the PCs are willing to talk, Steward engages them in conversation and Server Two provides cakes and tea. The automatons in areas L6 and L8 gather at the doors to listen in. The automatons are all awaiting the return of Nhur Athemon and other Cyre exiles. The Sanctum automatons ask the few living humans who enter this level whether they are the long-lost “Patrons.” So far the answer has been no; the Sanctum staff serve as they are programmed to, and return to their hopeless vigil when their guests depart. While most of the automatons are awed by the PCs, Steward is stern and calm, like an elderly butler: very polite, determined to make sure that every service is provided, and ever so slightly disappointed in his guests. His responses to likely PC questions and comments include the following.

Who are you? “I am the Steward of the Sanctum, and I have kept this facility running in anticipation of your return. Though we did expect you sooner.” What services do you provide? “We can provide you with light refreshments—Chef Two has prepared kelip cakes with a candied glaze, and the silver-tip tea is particularly invigorating. Our oasis offers a variety of relaxing treatments, and if you are injured, we have a small supply of restorative salves.” What do you mean, “our return”? “The Prince,” (he glances at the painting) “created us to serve the Patrons. When he had to shut down the transit system, he told us to keep things running until he returned. And so we have.” We aren’t the Patrons. “Are you not cast in the image of the Prince? You may not be the Patrons we expected, but you are certainly their heirs. We’ll serve you as promised, and in turn I hope you will see fit to restore us.” Why are you just a head? “Over the centuries, many of us have suffered damage beyond our capacity for repair. But now that you have returned, you can restore us.” If Steward realizes that the PCs aren’t the Patrons, he tries to make the best of the situation and help his people, providing the information below. What do you mean, restore you? “You… don’t know? Then the answer lies in the Iron Crèche. If you could take me there—past the Reclaimers—I could restore the Sanctum and my staff.” Why should we? or We’re trying to go further down. How do we do that? “You wish to descend below, to explore the palace of the prince? There is an elevator platform beyond the Iron Crèche. I can provide you with a transit code if you take me to the crèche. However, it may be dangerous. The Reclaimers seek to consume us.” What are the Reclaimers? “The minions of the Iron Crèche. It is their task to maintain the facilities, but many years ago they came to the conclusion that the staff of the Sanctum were no longer required. They will consume us and recycle our pieces if you let them. But if you bring me to the crèche, I could redirect this aggression.”

Steward also tends to the needs of the PCs. Should the party consume the tea and cakes, they have the effect of heroes’ feast (CL 11th, 1d8+5 temporary hit points).

**Treasure:** Steward can provide up to three potions of cure serious wounds. The painting depicts the great deeds of Nhur Athemon, cycling through a few hours of content. As a feat of illusion and historical document, it could fetch 2,000 gp.

**Quest:** When Steward explains how the PCs can restore the automatons, the PCs gain the Restoring Power quest.

**L6. Oasis** A large pool fills the center of this room, and the steam rising from the warm, perfumed water fills the air with comforting scents. The lighting is low and soft, and the relaxing sound of faint chimes comes through the air. An automaton arranges salves, powders, and files at a beautician’s station, while another stands next to a curved massage table. Towels, fresh fruit, strange delicacies, and a few books are close at hand, near four lounge chairs. This is the heart of the spa. The pool uses the principles behind prestidigitation, create water, and purify water to maintain the water’s temperature, volume, and purity. Creatures: Massage One and Beauty Two are the only oasis attendants remaining. They are eager to wait on the party. Beautician: This talkative automaton begins gushing over the nearest PC immediately. It’s equipped with skills and magical talents similar to *prestidigitation* and *alter self*. Given time, it can change anything from hair length and style to skin color. Massage: Massage One has only one functional hand, but its invigorating massage provides the benefits of *lesser restoration*. A single creature can be affected only once per 24 hours. Recliners: Sleeping in the spongy lounge chairs provides the full benefits of rest in half the usual time. A 10 minute rest here functions as a short rest (affected by the spell *catnap*).

**L7. Apothecary** This workshop was once an alchemist’s dream. There are fermentation vats, tubes filled with glowing fluids, a vast array of mixing containers, and a small bottling system set against the east wall. But two of the massive tubes are shattered, and most surfaces in the room are covered with a shiny purple resin that might have been some sort of slime before it crystallized. Extreme heat emanates from a chute in the southern wall. The Sanctum automatons don’t know what’s in this room. Centuries ago, an explosion crippled the equipment. Machinist One was destroyed while trying to repair it; since no one else understands it, they’ve avoided it ever since. The room is completely silent and still. A PC who succeeds at a DC 16 Perception check can see that some flasks in the southeast corner might contain salvageable potions. The crystalline coating is thickest just outside the shattered tubes. The hatch on the southern wall leads to area L12, and if the PCs have sufficient protection against heat, it’s a way to avoid exposing the Sanctum to the Reclaimers. It takes 2 rounds to squeeze through the tunnel between the apothecary and the furnace, and PCs take 5 points of fire damage each round. Creature: Most of the crystal coating is inanimate. However, if PCs venture into the east chamber or attack the crystal growth next to the central tube, it shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces and flows toward them in a razor-sharp mass.

**Syndra -- L8. Kitchen** A small kitchen opens into an aquaponics chamber. The smells of unfamiliar plants are heavy in the warm, damp air. The tanks are filled with water, vegetation, small fish, and shellfish. Attached to the tanks are facilities for transforming the contents into meals. The door to the north appears to have been barricaded. There’s an audible metallic noise through that door, like dozens of blades scraping against it.

Opening the door requires disassembling the barricade. However, this prospect terrifies the automatons. If Steward is with the PCs, he tells them that if the Reclaimers get inside, they will destroy all of the staff. While the party may be able to destroy the Reclaimers waiting outside, there will always be more. So if the PCs care about the Sanctum, they will need to put up a new barricade once they are through. If the PCs take Steward with them, he can provide helpful advice (and sarcastic commentary), though he doesn’t know everything about the maintenance systems.

**L9. The Reclaimers (CR 6)** The walls and floor of this short hallway ripple as if alive— every surface of this hallway is covered with a wave of tiny constructs. At rest, these clockwork abominations resemble a pile of debris and scrap on the ground, but in motion it reveals a large insectoid form with smoke rising between the plates of its hide Its many orange-yellow eyes shine like dim lanterns. They look like they were originally beetle-shaped, but have incorporated pieces of junk into their construction and are now covered in rusted protrusions.

Encounter: 2 *Diseased* Clockwork Abominations* (*TOB 59*). CR 5.

***Sewer Plague -** Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats. When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of Exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points from spending Hit Dice and no Hit Points from finishing a Long Rest. At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of Exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s Exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of Exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

The Reclaimers are a discorporated junk golem that pick apart whatever they come across. They wish to get into the Sanctum so they can dismantle the servants and reincorporate the servants’ components into their own bodies, but they’re happy to start with the organic. If the PCs fling a sizable piece of an automaton at the Reclaimers, the constructs remain stationary for 2 rounds while breaking it down. If the Reclaimers reach the Sanctum, the magic in those areas prevents the Reclaimers from causing disease. (see *Re-Animated Raider*).

**L10. Processing Chamber - Chemical Waste Disposal (CR 8)** This chamber is a shallow pool. The bottom is lined with a glittering layer of liquid metal. The “water” breaks down dead and inorganic materials. Mundane materials dissolve quickly, but magical items are more resistant. If PCs explore the pool, they find a layer of liquefied metal at the bottom, and see that many of the objects they saw are already liquefied and unsalvageable. The fluid destroys mundane cloth instantly on contact; mundane metal and stone can survive 1 round of exposure, but melt on the second round. A PC who removes all mundane materials can stand in the pool and sift around to search for hidden treasures. Someone standing in the pool can attempt a DC 20 Perception check once per round; on a successful check, he finds one of the three **treasures**:

- a bead of force
- a ring of protection +1
- +1 greatsword

**L11. Rendering Hall (CR 11)** A pool of glowing green liquid that smells like rotting flesh dominates this massive chamber. Long, metallic tentacles writhe around the edge of the pool, like snakes searching for prey. The green fluid in the pool breaks down organic matter, dealing 10 points of acid damage each round to organic creatures or objects.

Traps: The metallic tentacles are programmed to grab any organic matter that comes within reach and dunk it in the pool until it dissolves. Atk +13 melee (1d8 plus grab); when a manipulator arm grabs a creature, it attempts a combat maneuver check with a +13 CMB to drag the creature into the pool in a square adjacent to the tentacle, dealing 4d10 points of acid damage (and another 2d10 points each round the creature remains in the pool). The trap deactivates if the initial attack misses, if it is severed (hardness 10, 30 hp, break DC 16), or once a grabbed creature escapes. The trap reactivates 24 hours later.

**L12. Furnace (CR 9)** Twisted, scorched metal fills this room to the ceiling. It was oviously once an area for smelting ore, but the equipment is torn and demolished. The stench of burning oil is overpowering. Molten metal covers the floor of this chamber. A pillar of flame at the back of the chamber pierces the smoky air. Anyone standing in the furnace takes 10 points of fire damage at the start of each round. The floor is covered in 2 feet of molten metal; moving 5 feet through this costs 20 feet of movement and deals 2d6 points of fire damage.

Encounter: The light at the heart of the chamber is a **fire elemental** bound to the furnace. It can reach far enough to lash out at anyone in the chamber. Once damaged, the elemental can attempt a DC 16 STR check each round to escape. CR 5.

A small window opposite the furnace, flanked by bookshelves, the shelves now layered with ash and dust. The green glass is fogged from the inside, obscuring a coliseum-spanning underground chamber. Legions of Karrnathian soldiers stand in ordered blocks. Goliath undead beasts tower over the inconsequential undead. The creature's hulking torso gives the the beast a gruesome appearance. Hanging from its shroud of decayed flesh are cages.

(PCP 15) They can hear an army of voices sounding to be in preparation and a war general giving a war speech:

*“We shall emerge triumphant from this dreadful war or be reduced to dust. We defend Karrnath with our spilled blood, our last breath, our very bones. Tonight, the coffins shall open, the graves be robbed, and the living shall breathe their last.”* — Madox Kaminarr, Karrn Bone Knight

The remaining undead army cannot comprehend the end of the war, as creatures embodying maleficent intent; they have been silently, restlessly awaiting redeployment.

**L13. Armory (CR 10)** If Steward is with the party, he warns them before they enter: “Many soldier automatons are stored within. They may be dormant, or may not. I advise proceeding cautiously.”

Hunks of twisted, partially melted metal covering the floor and walls of this unlit room are the remains of suits of armor and weapons. One suit of plate, held up by a stanchion in the center of the room, appears to have survived. Every space along the walls of this large storage chamber consists of tall, vertical sockets of human-like size and shape. Some lie empty, but most are occupied—no fewer than twelve automaton soldiers stare blankly out from the sockets into the chamber. Four are much larger than the others, standing as tall as ogres in oversized receptacles in the center of each wall. The door to the southwest is guarded by faint arcs of electricity, like widely spaced bars across the mouth of the alcove. At infrequent intervals the arcs brighten and fade. The automatons produced by the Iron Crèche were used throughout the Orphanage, but were stored here until needed, at which point they teleported to the level of the threat using the transit portal.

*A humanoid corpse shambles toward you, its flesh riddled with hoses and metal plates. Grotesque metal rods replace large portions of its form with no rhyme or reason as to their placement or purpose. What appears to be writhing tentacle-like appendages originate from the construct’s centralized, core unit encapsulated by decaying flesh oozing an acidic substance.*

Encounter: Of the 12 automatons in this armory, only the four giant automatons are active—the ordinary-sized ones don’t activate even if damaged. **4 Variant Re-Animated Raider** (CoC pg.360) - each have one variant actions from Flamethrower, Pesticide or Sterilizer.

**L14. Iron Crèche (CR 11)** Hundreds of small gemstones orbit it like tiny moons. A control panel is embedded in the spire just above the floor—a marble and adamantine altar studded with gleaming crystals. Arcane patterns of cold fire blaze on the floor of the chamber. Two massive, coffin-like structures stand to either side of the room, with three smaller ones around them. The air is cold, and tingles with magical energy. The coffin-like structures are replication chambers, used to create new automatons or swarms of Reclaimers.

**Prototype Lab** Shelves contain artificial limbs, heads, torsos, and other parts of incomplete constructs— humanoid and otherwise. Mindless models for warforged prototypes dwell in these chambers. Unlike normal warforged, these creatures rely on an arcane generator to function.

**Arcane Generator** As an action, a player can make a check to disable the Arcane Generator: Arcana (20), Athletics (15), Thievery (20), or attack (AC 10, HP 90). Each of its turns, a destroyed allied construct within 10ft gains 1 HP, reactivates and can act. If no destroyed allied constructs are present, the burst grants 5 temporary hit points instead. 2d6 + 5 force damage and 5ft push back (DEX save 15).

Beyond the opening is a room finely wrought of white stone with gray-green veins and flecks. A large arcane contraption of metal and stone stands in the center of the room. It is about 7 feet high; levers project from it, runes shine on its surface, and a large purple crystal glows at its apex. Standing about the room are humanoid creatures like warforged. Some are incomplete or worn with time, while others have fared better. Most of those are wide-framed models that resemble the burliest human. One appears to have a sheathe of flesh that has been cut or torn away in places, revealing inner workings that are thinner than those of a normal warforged. As you enter, the eyes of the inert constructs glow with the same purple color as the crystal at the top of the strange device.

Encounter: 3 Fellforged (*TOB* 182) CR 5.

**L15. Central Atrium**

The central atrium of the facility appears encapsulated by glass walls containing a vast amount of water, spanning the height from floor to ceiling, the water's surface level remaining out of site. The illuminated coral floor ahead falls away in a marked declivity, and bears curiously regular blocks of stone in certain places, disposed as if in accordance with definite patterns. You see an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices; magnificent though unclassified architecture in various stages of preservation. Most appear to be of marble, gleaming whitely in the rays of light given off by softly illuminating everbright lanterns. Numerous isolated temples and villas appear on the steep slopes toward the far side. You examine the scene more closely, and behold the remains of stone and marble bridges and sea-walls, and terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful. At the end of the city, facing a cliff wall, you are confronted by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building, evidently a temple, hollowed from the solid rock. Of the original workmanship of this titanic object you can only make conjectures. The facade, of immense magnitude, apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its windows are many and widely distributed. In the center yawns a great open door, reached by an impressive flight of steps, and surrounded by exquisite carvings in relief. Foremost of all are the great columns and frieze, both decorated with sculptures of inexpressible beauty; obviously portraying idealized pastoral scenes and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial devices in adoration of a radiant god. The art is of the most phenomenal perfection, and imparts an impression of terrible antiquity, as though it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of elven art. You cannot doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of the cliff wall. It is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated you cannot imagine. Perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the nucleus. Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this temple—for temple indeed it must be— it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of the chasm. Standing immediately juxtaposed to the glass walls, approximately human-shaped, though exhibiting amphibian-like traits, several aquatic humanoids encircle a statue depicting a god-like being, also amphibious, a writhing mass of tentacles and scales. The sound of chanting, though muffled, echoes through sound-emitting pipes into the room.  

*Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fhtagn! Ph'nglui mglw'nfah Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!* *Raq Dagon nišdar Dālāyw*! 
(In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming! Only Dagon was left of him!)

Sinking mechanics: (limited time, based on lowest Constitution modifier * 10 rounds)

- When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
- **Swimming:** movement costs * 2, * 3 for difficult terrain (gaining any distance in rough water requires an Athletic check DC 12).
- A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

**Drowning**

After 1+ CON mod. minutes of holding your breath underwater you fall unconscious, your hit points fall to 0, and you can then survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). After that, you begin making your death saving throws as per the standard rules. However, if you become stable there is a problem. If you are still under water you can’t remain stable. So you must start making death saving throws again. This continues until you die unless you are saved in some way.

---

**Extended Dungeon Ideas**

**L15. Ruined Foyer** The door opens into a large, octagonal room that must once have been magnificent. The large symbol set into the floor still looks impressive, but the southern wall is completely shattered. Rubble is scattered everywhere, and some of the room’s southern section is blackened as if by an explosion. A large number of clearly humanoid bones are also strewn about the area. Numerous tiny nozzles project from a groove in the room’s walls, at least a dozen on a side. An apparition rises through the floor. It is a semi-translucent, elderly male dressed in the finery of House Cannith. At his heart burns a spectral blue flame. His eyes, mouth, and hair share a similar fire.

“Look who else has come! What are you people doing here in my forge?… I am **Haestus d’Cannith**, the overseer of this place. You might already have seen some of my work. The golems? The warforged prototypes? I am something between living and dead, and greater than either. My power in life allowed my spirit to remain kindled even in death. I am a soul alight with the forge’s fire”

“Perhaps I’ll see you again, but I hope not.”

His eyes flash, and pieces of bone around the room tremble. He sinks into the floor, and as he does, bones dart through the rubble, meeting each other and knitting together. A spectral blue flame lingers in the spot where he was. It pulses, filling the nozzles on the walls with a pale glow, then goes out. (stats *Forgewraith*)

Whole bones knit to form a sinuous form like a centipede with ribs for legs. A human skull caps the monstrosity. Bits of broken bone, teeth, and ash gather in tiny humanoid shapes that mass in swarms to attack.

• Sterilization protocol. The room fills with a poison gas. Everyone in the room must make a DC 18 constitution save. If they fail, they are poisoned and take 4d6 poison damage or half damage on a success.

• Cleaning constructs powered by the souls of victims. These tiny devices pour out of the walls and attack one creature that Haestus can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. If someone is reduced to 0 hit points this way, their body is dissolved. The tiny constructs retreat back into the walls.

**L16. The Catwalk** The marble of the passageway gives way to steel-covered walls and the flicker of fire from below. The hallway opens onto a steel catwalk, which narrows to a 10-foot-wide bridge as it crosses to the other side. Thirty feet below, molten metal churns. A fine mesh is stretched across the room about 10 feet above the chasm, and on it rests charred humanoid remains.

Count Vedim ir’Omik in his creations for the oncoming *necrogenesis*.

Count Vedim ir’Omik & Baron Haestus d’Cannith (necrogenesis)

- mad scientists seek to restore power to Erandis Vol (?) & Karrnath
- believe the King has become weak and needs to be replaced with a true leader

**L17. Elevator Chamber** The hatch opens into a chamber where a vertical shaft drops into darkness farther than the eye can see. A square platform about 8 feet in diameter hovers at the top of the shaft. There is a bronze lever on the wall near the door, currently in its “up” position. The elevator stone and switch are described below. Descent to the Next Level The shaft descends more than 200 feet to Level 13. The levitating platform can support up to 5,000 pounds. Above that, its enchantment fails and it plummets to the bottom of the shaft. The lever is a “call button” for the platform, and switches to reflect the elevator’s current position. If the lever is flipped down, after 3 rounds the elevator begins to descend to area M1.
