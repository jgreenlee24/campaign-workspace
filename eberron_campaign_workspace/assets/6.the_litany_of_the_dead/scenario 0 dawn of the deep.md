*Rain. As you reach the roof, you feel a wave of vigor hit you, like a crisp cold breath of air, then a heartbeat later, numbness creeps over you as the freezing rain drops against your skin. As if awaking from a deep slumber to a vastly hostile world, the grays of the desolate surrounding, its harsh, muted palate drains any sensation of life. The soldiers are sheathed in flesh-like suits of armor, a union of hard leather plates and human bones. You see one whose enflamed, impassive eyes appear to scan the surrounding from within its skull-faced visor. A noxious, resinous stench permeates the air. Flanking the sides of the legion, decorated constructs, though framed in humanoid silhouettes, wield seemingly organic, exotic weapons; the armor designed with almost tribal markings, paints of interconnected concentric circles. At the rear of the brigade, a towering humanoid figure encased in ash-colored plate armor, without issuing any verbal commands directs the group. It carries a serrated khopesh (curved) sword in spiked gauntlets that hiss with violet smoke as it is dragged across the ground, and a horned ivory mask devoid of features is nailed to its face. (Mask Wright, TOB 285). Overhead, a mass of fused corpses resembling a butterfly with wings of rotting skin, limbs of bone, and a head formed of several different skulls glides high above you. Its toothless mouth spreads wide in hunger. The dark magic that formed this abomination swirls around it hungrily. It begins moving in circular pattern. A distant, shadowy figure flickers in and out of view. Its indistinct shape betrays a sylvan ancestry, and its eyes are malevolent blue points of light. It flickers again, appearing as an ethereal ghost wearing gladiatorial armor, its eyes emitting a bright blue.*

**Encounters:** *Mask Wright (TOB 285), Flutterflesh (TOB 203), Deathwisp (TOB 72)*

A cloud of dust, like a lingering fog, looms in the distance ... and floods the city in moment's breath, the rotting wind bringing a chilling gust to the air, turning nearby foliage to dust. (*Rotting Wind*, *TOB* 330).

Soneste whispers in a hushed breath, "We need to move. *Now*."

**The Mausoleum.** The trail eventually leads them to a stark white marble edifice, 100 feet tall, with ornate geometric patterns carved into the pale stone. The only obvious sign of the Keeper on the outside of the building rests on the door, which depicts a wicked curved dagger, holy symbol of the Sovereign of Death and Decay.

**Golden Dragon Inn.** The wooden sign outside displaying the eponymous Helpful Hound, the coveted Gold Seal of House Ghallanda, is faded and chipped, and the paint looks more gray than green at this point.

**Notable NPCs:**

- **Draci Lonn.** A middle-aged shifter woman, priest of the Keeper. She is a steward of Gath’s mausoleum and a student of the ancient lich’s necromancy.
- **Cagyn Rilid**: A Cyran fisherman, employed by House Cannith, sulking in the corner. A deep sea diver recently returned to shore, telling a tale of a lost companion and jellyfish that seemed to be made of human hearts. Believes the "airborne plague" is in fact a seaborne spinal parasite. He begs for someone to rescue his friend—or at least find out what happened to him.

*Well then, come to hear my story have you? To determine whether I am fit to stand trial? And of what crime am I guilty exactly? Is it a crime to be afraid, to last out and fear, to speak in truth, to endure horrors unbeknownst by man? ... Your opinion is of no interest to me, since by tonight, I shall be no more. Locked away in my supply of the drug which alone made life endurable, confiscated by the ruffians who kept me here against my will. I can bare the torture no longer, I shall hang myself by the bedpost. When you've heard my story, you may guess why it is never fully realized I must have forgetfulness or death. It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad Pacific that the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim to the Lhazzarian sea-raider. The great war was then at its very beginning, and the ocean forces of Breland had not completely sunk to their later degradation, so that our vessel was made a legitimate prize, while we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as naval prisoners. So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time. Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds. I think I went mad then. Of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang a great deal, and laughed oddly when I was unable to sing. I have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after I reached the boat; at any rate, I know that I heard peals of thunder and other tones which Nature utters only in her wildest moods. When I came out of the shadows I was in a hospital; brought there by the captain of a ship which had picked up my boat in mid-ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found that my words had been given scant attention.*

*Along the ocean’s floor can one find the celosia—sea spiders that thrive inside the hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the Karrn Bay. The celosia release blue bioluminescent mucus when disturbed; this biochemical mucus, when mixed with fresh water, becomes the gharolan, an infused chemical compound capable of powerful regenerative and cleansing capabilities.*

**3 locations of facilities given:**

- Metrol on Lake Cyre
- Southeast of Mournland on Kraken Bay
- Southwest of Tanar Rath on Scion Sound

Jurian offers an idea for a Mournland expedition - this current ship is not equipped, however House Lyrandar and Thrashk have been recognized as making several attempts at exploring and extracting/salvaging artifacts from the Mournlands. Perhaps, go to a nearby Docking city and arrange safe passage.

Korth: Barry's Bags (clerk named Bernard, working on Bag of Devouring (for the kiddos))

**Karrlakton** one of the nation’s greatest cities, suffers terribly from its proximity to the Mournland. The populace lives under a pall of despair, and many have fled the city. They have been replaced by crazed prophets and doomsayers who predict the end of the city—if not the world—when the Mourning spreads. Still, the city survives as one of the preeminent sources of arms and armor in Khorvaire. Karrlakton is filled with training areas, barracks, weaponsmiths and armorers to serve House Deneith. Sentinel Tower is also the headquarters of the Sentinel Marshals, who return whenever their assignments permit. Sentinel Marshals (specialized form of mercenary, bounty hunters empowered to enforce the laws of Galifar across Khorvaire, a neutral law-keeping force).

*The Golden Dragon Inn. The faded green sign displaying the herald crest of Ghallanda creaks on its hooks outside. Sound is muffled for a moment, as your bodies escape the cold Karrnathi winds and adjust to the new surroundings. The Golden Dragon Inn, just like the one in Sharn, the familiar red leather, cushioned seating, and smoke-filled air; tinted lights cast shadows upon the painted, darkwood walls featuring artistic flourishes and brushstrokes. A couple of men huddle in one corner of the bar, drinking with an almost quiet determination, avoiding serious discussion of troubling news. You feel your feet nearly sink into the soft wooden flooring underfoot. A sudden warmth overtakes you from the black stone hearth holding the heat of a tempered flame. Rubbing along the grain of the bar slowly back and forth with a white linen cloth, a man leans over the counter, polishing a stretch of mahogany that already gleamed in the lamplight. A green lampshade rests as the centerpiece of the table. A moment later, two unrecognizable women arrive.*
