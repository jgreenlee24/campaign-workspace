“The Salvage Board”

The salvage outpost of Sanctuary includes a rough-and-tumble tavern called “The Gray Beyond”.

Usually these bills are posted by the salvage brokers of Salvation (or their representatives), although others may post bills for private jobs.

Also, since K’atai has word of recall, we will need to populate / add content for Sanctuary.

998 YK (18 years passed) - Valenar

*Since the day of Mourning (994 YK), Khorvarian societies have adjusted to their cold-war state. Thousands of Cyran refugees have attempted to assimilate in various communities, 
but many have received the opposite of welcome. Sanctuary was a place of salvation; a stratified community built by the very hands of the refugee survivors. The once encampment 
grew into a diversified camp city. The native Ghallandan halflings worked alongside the immigrants, providing a sense of comfort and hospitality amidst the arid desert of the foreign plains. 
Four years passed as the community grew and thrived. On Olarune 6th 998YK, a nomadic tribe of Valenar elves ambushed the city. In a failing contest of strength against the weapon mastery of the elves, 
the inhabitants failed to protect what was theirs. Their city was pillaged, their lifelong belongings taken away. For those short-lived refugees, Sanctuary became only a place of suffering and sorrow. 
The survivors scattered. Many fled to New Cyre, a similar outcast community in Breland. Others returned in hope to the once shining city of Metrol, with a misconstrued belief that their once beloved 
homeland could one day be restored.*
