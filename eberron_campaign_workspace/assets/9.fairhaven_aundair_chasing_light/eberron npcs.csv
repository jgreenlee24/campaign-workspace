Like Aurala, he is a politician instead of a warrior. His morals place him above intrigue and outside the grasp of corruption. The queen can rely upon him to render advice that holds at its foundation the best interests of Aundair and its ruler. He prefers peace, however, and this colors his counsel. He counts himself and Aundair lucky that his sister believes that the crown of Galifar must be acquired through strategies subtler than outright warfare. He is married to a woman named Wrenya and together they have five children, including an adolescent daughter named https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Austasia_ir%27Wynarn.","Aundair, Fairhaven",,"Moral, Peace",,Human,Governor,Alive

Ulina Pyranim,Morgrave University,,"Ulina is a student at Morgrave University studying Ancient Giantish language and culture. She isn't particularly noteworthy, except that she's been constantly plastering ""looking for Xen'drik adventuring party"" notices in every tavern and guildhall in Sharn for years now, so she's become a running joke to the Watch who amuse themselves by reading over her latest postings whenever they crop up.","Breland, Sharn",,,,Halfling,"Researcher, Student",
Aldric d'Cannith,House Cannith,"Aldric is a prodigy when it comes to crafting and using potions and wands, and was the youngest person chosen to head any branch of the Fabricators Guild since before the Last War. He studies arcane magic as well, specializing in spells for the creation, shaping, and animation of matter.","The 37-year-old arcanist is the nephew of famed artificer Aaren d'Cannith, the man who discovered how to grant sapience to warforged, and the second cousin of Baron Merrix d'Cannith. He has spent much of his time with the Twelve researching everything he can about warforged, making him a person of interest to the intelligence agencies of every nation of Khorvaire, since they all keep tabs on anyone who might be inclined to break the Treaty of Thronehold's prohibition on the creation of warforged either accidentally or intentionally.",Metrol,,,,Human,Researcher,
Toahil Ziventi,Morgrave University,"Toahil has the art of elemental binding down to a science and is one of the most efficient crafters in the binders' ranks. He specializes in air and water elementals (and their variations, such as ice paraelementals and lightning quasielementals) to the point that much of his body has been replaced by such elemental matter, and he can summon powerful elementals with a thought. His expertise with elemental grafting extends to construction of warforged grafts and elemental arms and armaments, and between that and his combat experience as a mercenary during the Last War he has a good amount of weapons training as well.","The 223-year-old gnome is, to the public, a beloved professor who has taught several generations of Breland's best and brightest at Morgrave University. Students love to hear the exciting tales of his youth spent relic-hunting in Xen'drik that he tells to illustrate almost every lesson, and students with little to no interest in either history or magic will take his classes just for that tendency. Toahil only teaches one or two small and specialized classes each term; during his youth the rest of his time was spent on expeditions, and now that he's gained tenure most of his time is spent in research. What most don't know, however, is that his true specialization lies in elemental binding. He is one of the premier elemental binders in Zilargo, and more than one sabbatical taken during the Last War for a ""Xen'drik expedition"" was in fact dedicated to optimizing magical crafting procedures to allow Zilargo to meet wartime production quotas for its clients. He literally wrote the book on much of modern elemental theory--quite a few books, actually--and every Zilargo-trained artificer knows his name.","Breland, Sharn",,,,Gnome,Researcher,

Like butcher's dogs, they almost slobbered in glee, almost fell over themselves with promises they could deliver the Ghash'kaala not just sanctifiable warforged but enough plans to construct these machinations themselves in exchange for carts of endless thousands of gold in fortune. One year later, Fangli received a parcel: a metal doll with a lacquered smile.
