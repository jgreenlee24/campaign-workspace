# The Lost Puppy

"Oh, the River Styx is a putrid stream, Oceanus is too good for me, Olympus takes too long to climb, Yggdrasil is justa tree. But the Infinite Staircase takes you there. The Grand Old Stair goes ev’rywhere. A few short steps will bring us home ... And fulfill our ev’y dream."

## Introduction

After their recent encounters in the Feywild, the players arrive at a nearby tavern (in the city of Fardale), late in the evening, welcomed by a large crowd of customers. Many races are present at the bar... Humans, elves, several dwarves. The tavern on the opposite side of the road, on the other hand, has no traffic at all strangely. From the inside, a high-pitched terrier-like barking can be heard and (DC 14 Perception check) also the sound of a teenage girl sobbing. Several guards are posted outside.

In the exciting tavern across the street, as the players enter, they can overhear some bar talk (irrelevant to the current campaign, but a reference to the previous):

Bartender:

- "Here you are Mary. So I h'eard Geraldine hired some of those Orange Templar folks to find her missing daughter. Perhaps, they'll take care of that house spider problem you posted outside while they're at it, don't ya think?"

Mary:

- "Oh.. Well I don't know about that. Most people around here think I'm crazy for offering so much money for people to kill a tiny house spider, but you know, it's not tiny at all. That house was my home and it just up and walked away! How does that even happen??"

A Clurichaun walks up to another player.. "heya, partner.. How about yous buys me a drink?" He continues to prod the player until he gets a stronger response. If the player refuses, the Clurichaun says, "You dirty <insert player race here or bastard>. Fine then. *smashes the bottle in his hand on the bar* Lady, how about you give me another and there won't be no trouble now..." - "What?! You must be joking. You've already had nine drinks and several flights." - "AH, but what's one more?" - "Get out." - "Make me." - *pulls out a woodchopper's axe* - "WOAH, woah... Alright, alright. I'm leaving." If the player purchases the Clurichaun a few drinks, the clurichaun eventually leaves a happy drunk and tells the player, "Best of luck on your adventures." (Player gains 3 luck points).

A fight breaks out in the opposite corner of the tavern. "WHAT DID YOU CALL MY MOTHER? SAY IT AGAIN!"

"What? Did I look like I was speaking to you?? I said nothing of the sort! You're a mad drunk! Sit back down!" *punch*

A tavern dragon chuckles as he walks from the area over to the bar for another drink, holding an obviously stolen pinkish purse of coins.

The bartender, of course, asks the players where they're from and what brings them to town. She eventually mentions the crowd-size being significantly larger the normal because all of the customers from the other tavern moved to this bar instead.. She expresses a little contempt, but also some sympathy for the Miss Alex next door and of course, her daughter, Allie. "That dog barking is driving away all of their business. I don't even know where they got the dog; there aren't even any dog breeders in this city."

Allie is a wizard in-training, despite her father's wishes. Her mother of course, is exceedingly proud of her and wishes her entry into the University of Nightingale to further her studies. She was casting the Find Familiar spell, making sure to carefully place all of the ingredients (charcoal, incense, and herbs) into a fire in a brass brazier, when suddenly a massive, hellish hound appeared and began terrorizing the city, killing many average city-folk and guards. After this, the dog returned to its owner, shifted to this cuter form and proceeded to bark at its shadow, which it has been doing every day for the past week driving away customers and testing the barkeeper's sanity. If the players inspect the dog's nametag, they'll see the dog's name is Cerberus (yes, the Guardian of the Nine Layers of Hell). The dog appears as a Hulking Welp, as its true form only shows itself (in the Material Plane) in the midst of absolute rage. The back of the dog tag says, "Property of Glasya".

## The Unseen University

When the players try to remember how to get to the Nine Hells of Baator (INT DC 15), there's many ways but you're not so sure the best, safest, or any sort of means of accomplishing the planar shift. Of course, the city of Nightingale with the University of Nightingale and its famous Library is a long walk, but short carriage ride away. If they choose this path and arrive at the Library, they again see Finny fin Finnigan who is exceedingly thankful for saving his life from the dragon in the maze and offers to help in any way he can. Finny can be found in the Library of Nightingale, this time in the "Cosmology" section studying interplanar travel. Having done his research of the library, he informs the group that the library, due to the disturbance of the dragon and possibly having been affected by the Seekers (mage guild) beforehand, is itself a somewhat blended plane of existence linking to the past and future. He's aware of the Unseen University's recent unison with the Library of Nightingale and rumors go, the Unseen University has access to the Infinite Staircase.

Torveir Kilnistoch, a human planewalker in love with a tiefling, Ghienna, seeks the PCs to deliver a formula for a potion to the wizard Oriam Trascallia on behalf of her teach Fyn Longfinger the Wise. He'll be at the "Planewalker's Guild" (within Sigil's Guildhall Ward, which they do not know). Torveir attempted to take a shortcut (series of portals) between the planes rather than taking the route to the Gates of Moon. In response to a refusal to pay debts, a local criminal named Ereth sent thugs to punish Torveir, who having arrived at the Prime Material Plane is now resting and healing at the tavern of the players. Torveir uses the amulet of whispers to contact the players, promising them 100gp each upon delivering the formula for him. Torveir contacted Finny already and gave him the formula and map to the Gates already...

The University of Nightingale is interconnected with the library, which in turn is interconnected with the "Unseen University" - only accessible by proceeding deeper into the library than originally gone before (as in, past where the dragon once resided (the cyclops is still there, but he is sleeping - Stealth DC 15 for the group)). The Unseen University is rumored to have a connection to a mystical staircase that scales the planes themselves (nowadays, they've added an elevator service (though it tends to break)). At the Unseen University, the players encounter The Librarian (an orangutan). The Librarian chooses to be an orangutan since a magic accident from a student polymorphed him into one and refuses to change back. He acts violently against anyone who calls him a "monkey".

As the players press on through the halls of the University, escorted by the Librarian to see the Headmaster, they pass by many students, studying different topics and the UU's mainframe computer the HEX, operated by Ponder Stibbons (a somewhat lazy, scatter-brained mathematician whose consistent maintenance work on the computer has had a severe impact on his sanity. The Unseen University Headmaster, Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully answers the players questions about the planes and shows them to the entrance of the Infinite Staircase (the one in the Engineering Department). He can also refer the players to a nearby Enchantment Shop which sells 2d4 Rings of Featherfall, such that they may survive the dynamic changes in gravity on the Astral Plane. First the players will proceed to the Infinite Staircase, which leads to Sigil, the City of Doors. Finally Sigil has a portal which leads to the Astral Plane. Portal going directly to the Nine Layers of Hell from Sigil are heavily guarded and only devils are allowed to pass through; all others must enter the Nine Layers via the Astral Plane.

This the location progression: Prime -> Library -> Unseen University -> Infinite Staircase -> Sigil -> Astral Plane -> First Layer of Hell (Avernus & River Styx) -> 5th Layer of Hell -> 6th Layer of Hell

Ways to travel to the Nine Hells (other than the Staircase):

- **Portal**: A portal is a magical doorway that instantly teleports the user somewhere else. Portals might go anywhere, and many require specific keys or actions in order to function. A portal is the easiest way to get to another plane, but you have to find a working portal that goes where you want to go.
- **Crossing**: A crossing is a place where the veil between the worlds is thin. Crossings lead to the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and other parallel planes. Crossings sometimes activate and function much like portals leading to corresponding points on the parallel planes. They also mark places where travelers can use passage rituals to reach the parallel planes.
- **Worldfall**: Large areas of the Feywild—for example, certain eladrin cities—sometimes shift to the natural world or back again. A traveler in the area of a worldfall is carried along when the area shifts to the other plane. Passage Rituals: If you’re at a crossing to the Feywild or Shadowfell, the ritual Fey Passage or Shadow Passage can transport you into the parallel plane.
- **Rituals:** Passage rituals are easy ways to move to another plane, but are limited because you need to find a suitable crossing point first. The ritual Astral Sojourn or Elemental Transference shifts a traveler to a random point in the Astral Sea or Elemental Chaos. You don’t need any kind of crossing point. If you have to find something lost or hidden in the Astral Sea or the Elemental Chaos, you might need to use a transfer ritual.
- **Teleport Rituals**: The rituals Planar Portal and True Portal create short-lived teleportation circles that can take travelers to specific locations on other planes. If you know exactly where you’re going and you have the sigil sequence to get there, a teleport ritual is the fastest way to get there.
- **Planar Vessel**: Magical ships such as planar dromonds or spelljammers have the ability to serve as navigation foci for the Plane Shift ritual. The Plane Shift ritual is a comparatively easy ritual that shifts the vessel and all its occupants into another plane.
- **Spells**: , , . Astral projection is the safest, though very expensive (requires rare jade-like gems valued over 100GP per player and a finely crafted silver bar). Planar requires a specially crafted tuning fork, attuned to only that singular plane (for astral, estimating 250 GP). Gate requires an extremely rare diamond (valued over 5000GP) - the diamonds are extremely rare to come by and it is not known whether any gates have been opened near the area, though since compasses are pointing fairly north, it's assumed there are no powerful magnetic-field altering spells nearby.

- **Astral Projection** was considered the safest mode of exploring because one's physical body was left behind in a (hopefully) protected location while their astral self traveled through the mostly barren Astral Plane to a that was the door to their destination. Upon arrival, a new physical body was formed out of the materials of the destination plane and this new body was therefore immune to any pervasive environmental hazards.

    color pool

- **River Styx**. Supposedly, entering the Nine Layers of Hell via the storm funnel above the lake that marks the source of the River Styx is the sole safe way of entering the Nine Layers of Hell.

## The Infinite Staircase

A Lilliend (very tall, snake-like humanoid, with colorful feathered wings) guards the entrance to the Infinite Staircase, asking "Welcome travelers. What are your intentions in entering the Staircase of Infinity?" The lillend will reference the stair's interconnectedness with every plane and its expansion due to its natural inclination to creative endeavors. Best be aware, one may find their heart's greatest desire through the doorways, it such a desire can be manifested in an already existing location; their creativity is their guide. She tells them that the stair is a magical pathway that is drawn to great concentrations of creativity. Thus, the Staircase mystically joins with any area on any plane where intelligent beings have expressed some sort of creative spirit. "Rising out of the day-by-day, well-ordered sameness, a creative idea is something from nothing. It is new and different. It is the ultimate expression of the beauty of chaos."

The professor (Arch-chancellor Mustrum Ridcully of Unseen University) bows to the guardian of the Infinite Staircase. The professor should point out the Gates of Moon is about an hour's walk down.

The first landing waits over a thousand feet above the level of the base, which is no longer visible at that point. The landing is a 200-foot disc, with numerous other staircases, all of different appearance and composition, extending off it like tentacles. Walls are no Ionzer visible: instead, each stair simply disappears into hazy darkness (visibility is about 250 feet].

"What you are standing in is a technological marvel. It is a gateway to everything that is and everything that can be. Sort of. Indirectly anyway. So... From here, you will venture down to the door of the Gates of Moon. Down further are subterannean planes, Astral Plane, demonic planes and the Nine Hells. Those rings I gave you are Rings of Feather Fall. You will need them once you are inside the Astral Plane (trust me, my first go-around there, I didn't have one and I broke my right arm so badly, I had not one, but two left arms for a month! Hehehe. Now then, this is where we must part as I have a university to manage and I'm told the Engineering Department just set the cafeteria on fire. Again."

The professor should address any questions the players have before leaving. Players should not know to go straight to the Gates of Moon, more than likely they will try to go further down, but once reaching the abyssal layer (just above the Astral Plane) the staircase becomes treacherous to climb down.

Here and there other staircases come into view, some of which appear to be upside down or at odd angles to the traveler's perspective. All are part of the same massive expanse, which bends and folds in on itself in a manner unperceivable by the traveler but no less real because of it.

Upon entering the Staircase, they players witness a stranger falling from the Celestial upper areas of the Staircase down to his presumable death, screaming on the way down. A player may make a Perception check to listen to the man's screamings. His voice eventually becomes quiet, then the sound of ripping ropes, and finally some groaning. (The man ended up in an Abyssal Spider's web).

The staircases are not particularly interconnected. Players will have to jump between moving staircases (DC 12 DEX). Otherwise they will fall 200ft to a flight of stairs below.

Encounters:

- Several doors at the end of staircases (nothing behind the door... The staircases themselves end with a small platform and the door). Prime Material Plane doors include:
    - Door leading to a Kobold Trapmaking Lair (as trapmaker kobolds are quite creative, it's only natural the Infinite Staircase would lead here). Several traps are in the area (on every staircase). Perception Check 15 to notice kobolds hiding in the distance behind a flight of stairs.
    - One staircase (and its door) is actually a very large mimic. DC 15 DEX as the players are walking down, or the player finds their shoe stuck to a purplish goo on the staircase.
    - One door leads to a deserted oasis in the Feywild. The steps to the door are composed of sandstone. The staircase is riddled with Cobbleswarms (see below).
    - Several doors appear to made of wood, presumably leading to taverns of small villages and large metropolies.

The door to the Gates of Moon is next. A massive slab of stone sustains a towering, majestic stone door with iconography of constellations, oceanic symbols and the phases of moons (several moons of varying sizes and color). Presumably characters will attempt to skip this landing and continue further down to the subterranean landing (Outer planes and Elemental planes).

Additionally, each Elemental plane (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Life and Death) have their own landing.

The Plane of Life (also called the Plane of Positive Energy) will heal injured adventurers who stay for a certain amount of time (no effect on disease) as well as enabling the Barbaric trait of halfing all damage for the next few minutes. The Elemental Planes have no air and enable creatures to discern their own subjective direction of gravity (WIS 18). The very weapons and armor that a creature is wielding become animated and often aggressive towards its owners. (roll a D6 to see whom it affects. Their weapons begin hovering and attacking them)

The players will also encounter a landing for Mechanus. The gates to the plane feature turning and winding gears of brass and stone. The landing is an extensive garbage dump composed of disposed modron parts stretching infinitely in any direction. Several malfunctioning modron appear to be taking bits and pieces of related gears, creating small stacks in an attempted orderly fashion. Modrons will attack any players in the viscinity if noticed. (DC 12 STEALTH)

## The Planewalker's Guild

**The Planewalker's Guild** is a landing within the Infinite Staircase.

An organization of adventurers who are based on the Infinite Staircase. They've been around for 900 years, and began as a protective society for planar travelers. Their headquarters is a large landing with tents and buildings. They welcome strangers, feed them and give them a place to sleep. Here's a few of the main members:

NPC's:

- Makim Shara - tiefling, bard who welcomes the players to the guild, offering drinks, shelter, potions, climbing equipment and anything else. Appears as a noble, well-dressed.
    - (actually a Rakshasa (wealthy, robed humanoid with the head of a tiger) in disguise. Rakshasa's are devils with a craving for humanoid flesh. They masquerade as wealthy, charismatic nobles in order to gain the trust of their patrons before devouring their flesh in secret.)
- Cadeon Nor, (human inventor) "If you happen to meet an old man scrawling drawings with his feet hanging off over the edge, you can be sure you've met old Cadeon, always working on his flying machine."
- Hav'run Thain: This minotaur leads the guild. He is peace-loving and is accompanied by a kyrie named Vagis.
- Oriam Trascalia: An old human wizard who doesn't do a lot of planewalking anymore.

The Planewalker's Guild includes Nowhere Inn: A community of tents and temporary structures on a wide landing. It holds a collection of roving merchants and misfits. If the group sleeps here, they may find some of their stuff has been stolen from a thief who is now long gone. Here's some places and people at this location:

- Ching-Dau: Lives in a pink tent, sells meat (venison).
- Allisa Misthaven: An elf who sells elven wine called Starclear. It's a watered-down impersonation of Evermead, a fine elven drink.
- Bruut: An ogre mage who offers to be a guide. He is a coward that places his own safety first.

The players arrive at the landing of the 66th layer of the Abyss, the Demonweb Pitts ruled by the Queen of the Spiders, Lolth. In between several unrelated flights of stairs, the webs appear to have captured several creatures of varying races, though most of them seem incapacitated by now. One fellow, an Elf named (Elwin Elneiros, L for short) calls out to the players for help. He lies to players, offering them gold and adventuring services (such as lodging, etc.) in exchange for helping him out.

## Sigil, the City of Doors

**Sigil, the City of Doors**. Accessible only via gate spell, thus the city is deemed relatively safe and peaceful. Violence is common due to the condensed population of angels and demons, but warring is forbidden.

Sigil is the bustling crossroads of the universe, full of portals leading to every known corner of the planes. Sigil’s inns and taverns cater to diverse clientele. Efreets from the City of Brass can find flaming halls of sumptuous luxury. Devils can enjoy a night spent in unthinkable debauchery. A traveler might lodge in an inn whose interior is like a twilit fey grove or a sunless cavern, or eat in a place that’s virtually indistinguishable from Fallcrest’s Blue Moon Alehouse. The Grand Bazaar, located in the city’s Market Ward, is a huge square overflowing into side streets, alleyways, and even nearby taverns. It is filled with caravan tents and market stalls. It pales in comparison to the bazaars and markets of the City of Brass, but deals in commerce appropriate to the size of the city. Other marketplaces spring up in many places throughout the city. Most appear during the day, but some appear only at night. Temples to all the deities—including evil gods whose shrines are rarely seen in civilized lands—can be found in the streets of Sigil. Most of them are small, and few claim any significant power in the city’s affairs. The city's closest thing to a law enforcement system are the Sons of Mercy (a citizen group) and the Sigil Advisory Council, neither of which can arrest or carry out sentences. Recently though, a new group of Kenku known as the Malphas (see ToB p. 283) have taken the responsibility of security into their own hands.

Adventurers who want to explore the Plane Above without traversing its hazardous sea often take up residence in Sigil, the infamous City of Doors. This densely populated and' geometrically improbable settlement is everywhere and nowhere at once. It occupies the inner surfaces of a toroidal structure floating in an undefined pocket dimension. Countless gates and portals to earthly realms and extraplanar realities riddle its smoky, byzantine streets. The most stable gates have been used to create outposts. These fortresses and hideaways in the planes serve as way stations for travelers and miscreants of all varieties.

Sigil is composed of 6 wards: the Hive Ward, the Lady Ward, the Market Ward, the Guildhall Ward, the Clerk's Ward and the Lower Ward. The players first arrive at the Guildhall Ward (being led by Makim Shara) and he quickly takes the over to the Market Ward, attempting to stay away from the center of the Great Bazaar, so as to not lose sight of the players. It is night-time and the sky is darkened with thunderous clouds overhead, though not raining, yet. He will introduce the great number of alehouses and taverns which the players can take lodging at. There, of course, if Fallcrest's Blue Moon Alehouse, ... The players arrive at a very Fey-like tavern, (a very natural, cozy, well-lit tavern (with a roaring central bonfire) decored with vines along the walls and numerous antlers and blossoming flowers - an aroma of fresh pine and flowers fills the air). Upon entry, Cerberus immediately begins barking uncontrollably. The players will see a familiar face sitting at the bar - the Claurichaun from earlier. He, of course, doesn't recognize them unless confronted and approaches the lady of the group, sweet talkin' for another drink. Finny excuses himself quietly, attending business matters with Torveir (bring him the formula for the potion as requested).

"Oh great, you people again... Lookie here now, I was just trying to get a free drank on-the-house, but the bartender wouldn't give me none. So, I thought to myself, these people look decently rich with their nice armour and stuff, might as well taken advantage of the situation, but no!!! Nobody is kind to the town drunk they say."

If the players are disobedient to the established norms of Sigil, 3 Malphas will appear (in silence, always) either then, or later at a tavern (depending on the what the players did - possibly with a bounty). 2 of the Malphas simply attempt to restrain the other players, attempting to knock them prone with their light shield, holding their blades to their throats, while the third Malphas attempts an assassination on the primary target.

The players need to get to Crossover Street, in Jiezou City, a subcity of Sigil near the Great Bazaar. The street is of course, completely controlled by the rich and powerful for means of accelerated tourism, rather than trade (see below).

**Crossover Street**: Jiezou City. Largely human population, particulary crowded in the lower areas of the city. Steampunk, river-based city. Buildings are a mix of oaken wood, brass and iron. Lanterns and bridges everywhere. Large buildings toer over Crossover Street. The Crossover Street is a highly controlled interplanar street, very costly to past through. Wealthy humans, known as tourists (obviously) pass through the street and appear on another plane, often randomly unless aided by a tuning fork. Wherever they end up, they consider their vacation spot for a few days before returning. Often used for interplanar business purposes, but not for commercial trade directly via the street as the area tends to be overpopulated in every plane and allowing caravans to travel through it would make on-time delivery impossible. Nobles and royalty line the winding streets leading up to the Crossover, in a line easily taking several hours per passing through. Elven scribes file through the paperwork of each caravan slowly, making sure everything is in order before allowing the caravan to pass through in order to prevent acts of terrorism. Guards line the perimeters.

## The Astral Plane

**The Astral Plane** acts as a super-highway between the Prime Material Plane and the Outer Planes. The Astral Sea is a great, silvery void where countless fragments of divine architecture drift. The Astral Plane has the following characteristics:

- **Subjective Directional Gravity -**

    WIS DC 16 to change direction of gravity per round. Rings of Featherfall are highly recommended. (Up to 150 ft per turn but remains constant once fully accelerated. Failure to make the check adds +6 to each following check).

- **Timeless**

    : Aging and natural healing don't function in the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane.

- **Enhanced Magic**[Quicken Spell](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#quicken-spell)[Quicken Spell-Like Ability](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/monsterFeats.html#quicken-spell-like-ability)[Quicken Spell](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#quicken-spell)

    : All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be employed as if they were improved by the

    or

    feats. Already quickened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the

    feat, only one quickened spell or spell-like ability can be cast per round. (Casters are able to cast two spells per round, or have a second action)

Arriving from the City of Doors, the players arrive at the main port city of the Astral Plane, Astral City, a spurring metropolis govered and managed by primarily celestial beings, though several devils are part of the Council as well as a Githyanki representative and Illithid (Mind Flayer) representative. Upon arrival, a celestial squirrel delivers a message from Makim Shara, celebratory on the player's safe arrival to the Astral Plane with instructions regarding finding a method of transit to the hells.

It is stormy and lightly raining when the players set sail. The players must find a vessel in order to eventually find the colored veil which leads to the Nine Hells. Admission to a vessel (astral skooner) is surprisingly cheap (30gp per person), but at level three, the players may not be able to afford this and must haggle the prices down. If the players say they know Makim Shara, after being questioned, the trade coordinator assigns them to an astral skooner trade ship that is preparing to set sail with 1,300 souls (slimely, shell-like ectoplasms encased in several barrels below deck).

## Skulls & Shackles: Wormwood - a Voyage to Hell

The players are greeted by Captain Morley 'Phantasm' Smithe. Smithe owes Mikam a debt for smuggling souls through the Infinite Staircase to avoid taxation back when Morley was first starting out as a tradesman. The Wormwood is a three-masted sailing ship, 100 feet long from stem to stern, and 30 feet wide amidships.

"Hold your salty water, why are ye trespassing on me ship?" The putrid smell of week-old alcohol permeates his breath. "Welcome aboard the Wormwood, planewalkers! Now then, where are ye headin'? ... Ye can bet your filthy souls, I'd go to war with the devils of Styx before I steer my ship into the cliffs of Malbolge. That'd be death upon entry. Now don't be mistakin', we are certainly headin' to hell. Our primary headin' is Port Peril of Erebus (the 3rd plane of Baator). Once business is done there, you can head on yer way."

The players can attempt to convince the Captain the sail straight into Malbolge, which case he suggests flying high above the plane and dropping the players into the plane from there to protect his ship from the mountainous terrain.

"Of course, I don't know how you feel about sky-diving, but we could fly high into the plane and drop ye below. The chances of death-on-impact are significantly slimmer, but of course, that chance is not negligible. Now I have in me possession some emblems that could help ye with the plane-shifting. Think of it like training flippers to get yer feet wet." The captain gives each player a medallion of astral projection.

"We'll be taking that equipment of yours, o' course. Can't be startin' a mutinee on yer first day aboard. Now then, on yer hands and feet -- it's about that time again boys! Time for the Bloody Hour. Now, drop to your feet and grovel. Hahaha." With a crack of his whip twice (WIS DC 14 w/ disadvantage twice).

At the sound of his whip, Cerberus drops his front paws forward, hind legs in a readied position to pounce and begins a deep growling. The captain stammers for a moment, caught off-guard. "Someone take care of the dog! Kick it overboard for all I care." The crew attempt to grab the dog, but the dog pounces on the first unlucky pirate to make an attempt. Cerberus begins to grow into a more forbiddable form. **Roll initiative**. On second round of initative, the riggers let loose the outhaul of the main mast as the second mate steers the ship to the left. The mast's sudden rotation knocks the massive beast into the water. Seeing nothing in its close viscinity, Cerberus panics returning to its smaller form for a moment. In two rounds, the dog returns to its hulking welp form, pawing the back of the ship from the water. The captain attempts to snap his whip of command to suppress the dogs emotions, "DOWN", he beckons. If nobody else does anything, the ship's wizard, Agio 'Salty' Stormvale, casts levitate and brings the puppy back from the water. As Cerberus is brought back on deck, the bard plays his lute and casts calm emotions. If not already addressed, the captain argues, "What is this monstronsity doing on my ship??... Well keep it under control!! What are you doing, ye scruvy dawgs?! Back to your duties!!"

The captain has a whip of command (5 charges). Several devils surround the PCs. With a crack of his whip, the players heads are knapsacked in slimely, leathery bags presumably bags used for the trade of the souls. (CON check 18 to not pass out, DEX check 15, to break free opposed STR check 13). If a player manages to break free, the players must make WIS saving throws (15 - no disadvantage) and CON saving throws (18) against the magical force of the medallions

Accursed medallion of astral projection - Moldy, brass chains with a worn-out coin with a skull-and-crossbones engraving and words transcribed in abyssal, the letters have faded in time and have become illegible -- irremovable and accursed with susceptability to charms (disadvantage). The medallions only function in the Astral Plane unless hijacked by a powerful wizard. Once apart from the Astral Plane, the medallions can only be physically removed by visiting a monastry or enchanter to remove the curse or disenchant the item. The curse is also lifted if the captain perishes.

The players awaken the next morning to the cracking of a whip and the bellowing voice of Masergy Scourge (a typical human swashbuckler).

"On your feet, ye filthy swabs! Get up on deck and report for duty before Cap’n Smithe flays your flesh into sausage skins and has Fishguts fry ye up for breakfast!”

The PCs discover their weapons, armour and equipment are missing. Looking at their hands, they see a faint silvery aura reminiscent of their humanoid hands. In astral form, the players can still take actions and cast spells, however any STR checks and DEX checks have disadvantage as they have become essentially weightless.

Conditions on the ship (once per day, players make a CON check):

DC 5 - nauseated - disadvantage on all actions other movement. CON 10 checks on movement or falls prone. DC becomes 15 in a stom.

DC 15 - sickened - -2 on all skill checks, attack rolls (poisoned)

Scrubbing the deck, she moves quickly aside one of the players. Sandara Quinn is a cleric of Besmara the Pirate Queen. She was captured and impressed onto the Wormwood a week before the players. She's managed to acquire a spellbook and crossbow from the player's equipment that she's willing to give them at no cost (in secret). The rest of their equipment is locked in closet guarded by Grok, the quartermaster.

The PCs are assigned a task (cook's mate, swab, or rigger) each day (see Wormwood Mutiny pg. 23 & 24 for assignment and duties).

Sandra Quinn - cleric of Besmara; job: swab

Wellington 'Mad Eye' Talon (hawk-like Kenku) - a dutiful sailor

Master Scourge, the Wormwood’s boatswain, master-at-arms, and infamous disciplinarian

Mr. Plugg, Wormwood's first mate

"Cut-throat" Grok - female orc, quartermaster who loves drinks, gambling and performances

Ambrose "Fishguts" Kroop, the cook (Triton sushi-chef)

## The Journey to Hell

Several days pass and the distant lights of Astral City vanish in a light, foggy mist over the horizon. The captain (if still alive) informs the group the portal's coordinates is a short distance away, but best to brace yourselves below the deck as it appears we are heading straight into a storm. As the players head below deck, they feel the entire ship shake violently and a loud commotion on the deck, originating from a nearby color pool, a Githankia astral skiff rams into the player's astral skooner. **Roll initiative.**

Once amidst the Astral Sea, the players are subjected to a raid of pirate Githyanki (5 + captain) and (round 2) a Psychic Storm - wild, unpredictable gales that darken the luminous clouds and blow travelers off course. A psychic storm affects a given area for 1d6 + 4 rounds. Psychic Storm Effects: The storm is accompanied by an Aboleth Nihileth and several smaller spawns of the creature. It seems not particularly attentive towards the party and is just passing through, like a rattlesnake through the legs of a human, but makes it way through the very center of the ship surrounded by a chilling crowd (10ft radius, 2d6 cold damage). All creatures in a psychic storm begin dazed and take 1d4 psychic damage every storm + possibly 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the wildly moving masts of the ship and 2d4 slashing damage from flailing ropes (DEX 15 saving throws). Each turn the ship rocks violently forcing everything to move up to 10ft the opposite direction of its rotation (DEX 15 saving throws). If the Githyanki successfully defeat the party, the party will need to find a way to escape. They will be questioned regarding their entry into the Sea, in hopes to discover the location of a color veil leading to the Material Plane. They will not believe the players if told otherwise.

Any creatures that fall unconscious, rather than making death saving throws, are captured and bound by the entangling ropes controlled by the captain; their wounds being tight pressed (stabalized, though unconscious), but their bodies moving with the rocking of the ship.

Githyanki Warlike and imperious, githyanki are a mortal race that inhabits the eternal depths of the Astral Sea. Their cities are forbidding, fortresslike holds built atop the rare bits of drifting rock in the astral and surrounded by vigilant patrols in astral skiffs. Githyanki are a cruel people who believe that all other mortal races are their inferiors and are to be enslaved or plundered at any opportunity. Githyanki eagerly seek out color veils or forgotten portals leading to the material world, for through these magic gates they can launch mighty raids against the unsuspecting people on the other side. Because of their hunger for conquest and riches, githyanki regard humans and other worldbound mortals faring abroad in the Astral Sea as great prizes—after all, the travelers came from somewhere and might be coerced into revealing the location of a portal the githyanki could attack through.

As pirates, the githyanki function slightly differently from how they do when they are engaged in pure military assaults. Although the githyanki are sadistic and evil killers, they usually recognize that massacring all their victims and burning what they can't haul to their ships will prevent their victims from generating more wealth to plunder in the future. When attacking defenseless ships of the border islands, or poorly defended areas ofthe border islands, the githyanki make a point of slaying a few random victims in spectacular fashion, then killing anyone who makes any show of resistance. Other wounds and abuse are at the discretion ofthe raiders' captain, but it's bad for the long-term prosperity.

Ironically, the military-minded githyanki don't like being reminded of the husbandry overtones of their raids. Anyone who tries to play on githyanki mercy or economic self-interest while they are being raided is likely to trigger a murderous rage, and the raid shifts into full military mode, leaving no survivors. For this reason, few of the githyanki of the Astral Sea bother with kidnapping. It might turn out to be profitable, but it's clearly a criminal act rather than a military operation, and thus beneath them. Githyanki will slit the throats (leaving the player coughing up blood and prone on the ground, zero health + death saving throws) of any who choose not to submit to their authority as an example to the rest.

## Avernus, the Burning Wastes & The River Styx

See Adventure: Hell's Bonds (the Plane Above - Secrets of the Astral Sea) for campaign beginning with arriving from the Astral Sea.

"Before you, a glow begins as you rocket towards an unexpected, endless permeable tapestry, a tangled lapse of burning, fire growing as you shoot forward. The vessels entrance to the other side emits defeaning sound waves of thunder and blinding flashes of light. As the rush of powerful energy subsides, you open your eyes to a rocky wasteland, stretching out endlessly to mountains along the horizon in all directions. Their jagged peaks stab up into the blood-red sky. The air is hot and still. It smells of rot and decay. The ground is a jagged amalgamation of dirt, bones, metal, and volcanic soil – all caked in blood. It appears to be littered with the detritus of countless battles. Here and there you see blood trickling out of the ground in vein-like streams. The sky is starless, full of choking smoke, and it glows a dark red due to balls of flammable gas that are floating about or streaking across the sky, randomly exploding as fireballs. The exploding of these fireballs are the only sounds you can hear, apart from the occasional distant screams that seem be coming from all directions. The air distorts with intense heat, the occasional ash and ember appear in the air arround you."

Once the players enter the fire planes of hell, their bodies become like what they were, but with a redish skin tone.

Players using astral projection gain the following attributes:

- Fire Resistance You have resistance to fire damage.
- Reach to the Blaze You know the produce flames cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the burning hands spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

The players enter the stony wasteland of Avernus, the redish deserts perfumed with the aroma of long-stained blood. The players arrive at night, crashing into the mountains. Fireballs careen through the atmosphere. Toothy mountains loom on every side, offering obstacles to those unwise enough to scale them, and sharp edges of crystalline rock tear at ﬂesh and clothing. Blood and viscera coat the entire surface of Avernus. The players arrive at the **Lake of Despond**.

This large, bitter lake marks the birthplace of the River Styx. Souls newly arrived in the Nine Hells awake on its rocky shores where they are quickly snatched up by devils assigned the task of collecting the damned. A great funnel-like storm cloud churning above the lake marks the only safe descent from the Astral Sea to Avernus, so most planar travelers arrive in the Nine Hells at this point. Naturally, the devils looking out for damned souls for the purpose of collection. The night sky fills with streaking fireballs and rolling clouds, golden, red, and black with gleams of sudden orange light, illuminates the perimiter of the shadowy facade. The air is hot, dry and fouled by volcanic fumes.

The party begins moving toward the Darkspine, shadowy cliffs looming in the distant horizon. Assuming distance can be relatively measured in view of distance measurement on the Material Plane, the journey to the Darkspine is easily a several days, maybe more than a week. (Survival checks per day, players should acknowledge what they choose to do each day to help the party in their travels).

## Michael - an Angelic Guide

**If there is a cleric in the party...**

You notice a single humanoid figure approaching. His appearance is divine, emitting a weak, radiant glow of light energy. He wears a white, though a bit tathered set of robes. As he approaches, he pulls back his hood to reveal his tall, thin face with shaved head and yellow, emotionless, eyes. “You are late,” he says. “You should have been here days ago.” “My name is Michael. I am your guide.”

Michael (actually Makim Shasa with a different appearance due to "Enhanced Alter Self" potions he has crafted...) appears to be a Protector Aasimar cleric -- he takes on this form completely (including wings). He carries a single "Token of Recall" (one charge - planar shift to plane of origin) - an angelic insignia on a brass chain hidden in his pocket. It's his way out of the plane, as he has not learned planar shift nor does he have the material components to cast it. He also has a bag of holding, which includes his alchemist supplies for brewing the "Enhanced Alter Self" potions, 5 potions of Greater Healing, planewalker's apparatus, 6 "Soul Cages", priest's robes, Ring of Blessing (5 charges), Ring of Path (5 charges), and a large book entitled "Book of the Living" with a number of names written on it. He casts minor illusion to make it appear as if a player's name has been recorded into the book - he proposes that this book enables him to keep track of the status of souls, given to him by the deities of the Celestial Plane.

Michael should inform the players of their need to retrieve a Rite of Passage, as there is no telling when his services elsewhere will be required. Michael will assist them by guiding them towards the Bronze Citadel. As for actually acquiring the document, Michael must leave the players to their own accord - aasimar, fallen or not, are not welcomed in these parts for obvious reasons. In exchange for his services, he requires an agreement where any valuable souls appropriated by the party in combat will be handed over to Michael (for his own personal reasons - "living expenses in the Nine Hells") as well as souls of the party. As a Rakshasa, these souls will instead be used to help improve his ranking as a devil.

"That cloud of dust in an army on the move. With a little luck, everyone will be too occupied with the war to notice our small group." ~ Michael, the angelic guide (bard stats: casts faerie fire, healing word, cure wounds, light, bless (because of the ring) to give the illusion that he's an angelic priest)

A large dust cloud hangs over the horizon slowly approaching with a low, rumblind thunder. A huge black mass emerges from the haze, streaming into thousands of distinct shapes, a scrabbling horde of devils. Seething masses of melted humanoids are scattered throughout the cloud. Other masses, with moreover defined appendages spill forward in front of the rank spurred on by jeering bone-like devils with leathery wings and barbed tails. Toward the rear, army banners are hoisted by an honor guard of monstrously large devils, twice the size of the others. Overhead flies a squad of winged devils. Many other unidentifiable creatures are scattered throughout. Devils ressembling the ones you just encountered, with chains being weighed down by its shackles. Insect-like creatures with multiples limbs, covered in nails, chains and rings of iron actually embedded into its burned flesh. Some devils with familiar, redish humanoid torsos resembling tieflings but with lower bodies covered in fur hold spears and trydants blazing with fire. Finally gem-coated humanoids with cruel, twisted faces, jagged teeth and terrible talons like shards of broken glass head the front-lines, acting as tanks, absorbing demonic strikes shielded by their crystalline exteriors. Two bone devils fly in the direction of the players, checking for enemy flanks (the players can check for places to hide in the crevices of the mountains they are beside - 1 perception check to locate + 3 athletic checks to climb the mountain + stealth checks).

## The Spine - Ribcage & the Malphian Protectors

The playeres need to go first to the Spine, a series of massive mountains shadowing endlessly deep caverns and pitfalls, treacherous to travel. In the middle of the Spine is a city, Ribcage, a gatetown to Baator (includes a highly protected portal to Sigil), though mostly engulfed in flames, the buildings turned to rubble, dust and ash -- a single tavern and a home remains operated and lived in by a single tiefling family, the Skhiakem family (Zeindes & Kellen). Ribcage, named after the corpse of a fallen deity, the ribs transformed to solid stone encaging the townsfolk, but offering protection from the corroding cliffs and stumbling stones from above. On either side of the ribcage stands a large iron gate, though purely protective from unforseen intruders - travelers would normally be welcomed in, though not demons. The city was built upon a high-traffic trail, used for trade and transportation of squads and war equipment. The tiefling families that built the city took advantage of this and created the city as a means for resupplying the defenses. Darkspine is also a city within the Spine, inhabited by a mix of many races, though mostly tieflings and abishai seeking refuge from Tiamat.

Ribcage was recently raided by a horde of demons who ransacked the town, a few years back. Since then, the city has been slowly rebuilding itself, but has undergone frequent raids from rogue kobolds who havec v. dug into homes to steal supplies from the townsfolk. A sect of raven-like humanoids (Malphas), native protectors of Sigil, have devoted themselves protect the village from unwarranted travelers.

## Draukari - Tucker's Kobolds

On the way to the Black Citadel through the Spine, the players encounter the spuring underground metropolis of Draukari, the realm of the kobold deity Kurtulmak. Draukari is a snaking network of tunnels and catacombs bursting with fiendish kobolds. Blood seeps from the surface above and drops down onto the inhabitants, covering their skins completely. This ghastly lubricant helps them writhe and wriggle through the mass of fellow fiends more effectively. Because they are free from hunger here, kobolds consider Draukari an absolute paradise. Periodically, however, the overcrowding becomes intolerable even for them, and a fiendish civil war ensues. Such a conflict culls out the weakest of the fiends and gives the strongest some momentary breathing room. However, given the vast population of kobolds in the multiple worlds of the Material Plane, it is never long before Draukari fills up once again. Draukari’s hideous reptilian stench can overwhelm non-kobolds as soon as they enter its claustrophobic passageways.

In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.

Looming overhead in the distance of the canyons of Draukari, Tiamat's Fortress is barely visible. A jagged, crown-shaped mountain redoubt. There are five watchtowers, each carved to look like the head and neck of a watchful dragon. The main entrance is only accessible to flying creatures.

**Level 1:** The Welcoming Traps - these traps are intended to ward off intruders

- "The Entrance": The entranceway has murderholes on the left and right sides with kobolds nearby to shoot crossbows through. Halfway through the hall is a 3x3 grease trap (2 large sewage pipes above) and a slight slope -- once a player slips and falls prone, the pipes release several gallons of grease pushing the players into a 3x3 pit trap (hidden by a illusion). Inside the pit trap is 3 ft of oil. The room is dark, so anyone who had a torch/lantern out would have it out (hopefully) when they fall into the oil, igniting it. If no fire is available already, the kobolds could toss fire in from a murderhole (2d6 fire damage per turn; Athletics check (DC 12) w/ disadvantage to get out). Spending 3 turns or more would  for anyone in metal armor in the pit, everyone's carried gear was covered in oil, and the oil subsequently ignited as they attempted to get out of the pit.

    hallucinatory terrain

    heat metal

- "Dragon Cannon": The players face a narrow corridor shrouded in darkness (darkvision can see though..). At the very end of the corridor, you can see what appears to be a sillouette of a dragon. The dragon unleashes a booming roar that echos through the tunnels as a massive wall of fire heads straight toward you (DEX 13 or 6d6 fire damage). A couple kobold sorcerers alternate fire attacks at the party while another set of kobolds hide in hidden, caved-out alcoves around and just beneath the hallways with small slits in the walls which the kobolds can move through to attempt to trip party members with a trip wire (6 total).
- "Entertainment Room": A room with checkerboard floors, and piles of bones. As the party enters the bones "animate". The skeletons are not actually animated, but puppeted by kobolds in the ceiling. Every 20 initiative count, one of the two colors becomes covered in spikes from the floor causing the party to dance around the colored tiles while fighting "skeletons" (DEX 15 - 2d6 piercing).
    - The bones can take significant damage before breaking, they "attack" but miss every attack.
- Following this is a bridge over a mined-out area.
- "Water Trap": A room with a pipe and a drain, with a number of beds/chests to attract the party (stolen from a nearby town). A solid iron portcullis (gate) would be lowered over the door and locked into place as the pipe's valve is opened by the kobolds and the room begins to flood. The drain had been clogged so clearing the water is as easy as emptying the drain, or stopping up the pipe somehow, or breaking open the iron portcu llis covering the door.
- "Cube Room": A large mostly empty room, a gelatinous cube sits right up against the entryway to another room, though it seems to be moving very slowly. The hall leading to the room has kobolds in secret hallways outside of the main hallway. When people enter the hallway they close off the door and being pushing an iron wall into the party, shoving them into the gelatinous cube. Within the cube room, a chest is encased in one of the gelatinous cubes. The chest is trapped with poison darts, the chest is contained within another gelatinous cube. The chest is empty. 9 gelatinous cubes are in the room, moving in a pattern (INT 15 - the pattern is very difficult to discern because cubes are hard to see/differentiate between one another). The cubes were baited by the kobolds and conditionally trained to move in this pattern.
- Another bridge which leads to a staircase. Above the entrance, (PCP 15) a large stone appears to be jutting out from the wall of the crevine, ever so-slightly spaced out from the surrounding rock.

**Level 2 -** Traps get much more serious. These traps were made to guarantee no adventure made it to the kobold's primary living quarters.

- "Indiana Jones": The wooden stairs to the 2nd level (down in this case) over a pit had a trap who's sole purpose was to be disarmed to release a boulder from the wall behind -- a watching kobold triggers the trap -- chasing whoever is in the hallway indiana jones style into the next level. In the next level, the hallway contains spike traps, harder to notice and dodge while running from a boulder.
- "Acid Trap": The ground of one hall is actually composed of sponge-like material, created from the fungi of the sewers. When a player steps or touches the organic matter, acid pours out. (2d6 acid damage). Moreover, the floors depth is great, completely absorbing the lower bodies anyone who falls into the trap - that creature is restrained and takes ongoing 3d6 acid damage until saved. On the ceiling, players will notice small holes carved into stone. Kobolds hide in the walls watching through hidden peep holes for the opportune time to trigger the holes to rain acid continuously onto the players (2d6 acid damage per turn). For those wearing metal armor, the armor becomes much less durable (-2AC).
- "Kidnapping": A surprisingly, mostly empty room. No traps on the floor, though the ceiling appears to be made-up of stone tablets with lose bits of gravel between each tablet. As the players enter, suddenly the room fills with magical darkness. 5 shadow-rogue kobolds attempt to take a player hostage as a bargain chip. If unsuccesful, they take Trixx, throwing him into a hollowed-out room.
- "A Surprising Shocker": A room with mist that coats anything that walks into it. This, along with the next room is well-lit with globes glowing in the corner producing light. Harmless on it's own, but the next room is completely metallic - iron. Lightnings carries through the entire room, stunning any players present (DC 15 CON or stunned). A kobold wizard and artificer created this room - the lightning is caused by a device in the room, triggered upon entry, casting equivocally thunderwave repeatedly (3d6 lightning). Players can keep on their toes to avoid the surges of lightning and take only half-damage (DEX 13).

**Level 3** - Much fewer traps, this begins the kobold's actual living places - a number of small areas with drinkable founts of water and edible fungi, even eggs guarded by a very protective cove of mothers - one kobold is carrying as many eggs as she can and running for protection, having been informed of the oncoming adventurers.

- "An Imposter": Within the 3rd level of the dungeon the party finds a surviving member of their guild (or some reputable source), the member is actually 3 kobolds working the plate armor like kids in a trenchcoat. The top kobold is a sorcerer and can speak various languages to (try to) trick the party into trusting them. The middle kobold is a fighter and prefers dual wielding weapons. The bottom kobold is a monk and uses kicks as monk weapons.
- "Poop Room": A profusely smelly room full of refuse enough that it has to be waded through. A successful perception check notices the bear traps spread (DEX 13 or 2d8 piercing) throughout the room and hidden in the refuse. There are also a number of tables in the room. Evidently this used to be used for storing equipment taken from dead adventurers. There are 2 chests in the corner of the room. The chest contains miscellaneous weapons, studded leather armour, a 2 potions of greater healing (2d4 + 4) . The trap immediately in front of the chest is actually a Gnarljak (living bear trap) which takes a readied action to bite any player near the chest.
- "Topsy-Turvy Bridge": Kobolds will sometimes construct a few stable rope bridges over existing chasms, hoping to foster a false sense of security, and then one topsy-turvy bridge when least expected. These 5-feet wide bridges flip over when a creature of 50 pounds of more passes over the trigger area. Stats: mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; DC 16 DEX; 40-ft. deep drop (4d6, fall); multiple targets (all targets within 10 ft. of target); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. Trap activates on the middle 5-ft. square of bridge.

    Note:

- "A Banquet": A room featuring a feast, kobolds had been eating in there recently, the food is mostly good, 1/2 of the food is poisoned with a damaging poison (CON 18 - 1d6 poison damage for 1d6 turns and the target is poisoned).
- "Bone Battlefield": An area composed of the skeletal corpse of a dragon - the sheer size of the draconic skeleton certainly indicates the dragon was magnificently powerful. The kobolds use the bones to gain 1/2 or 3/4 cover. The dragon corpse *optionally* comes alive during the fight  the kobolds didn't have a clue it was still alive. 2 kobold sorcerers, 2 kobold rogues and 3 kobold trapsmiths. Alternatively, the dragon's presence (though dead) causes certain lair effects. The last couple of kobolds remaining use beg, cower and grovel and plead with the adventurers as an additional, hidden kobold attack with a crossbow from behind. "It has been a long.... Rest. Do tell me, mortals, have I regained my flesh?... No? What a surprise. It seems you have woken me in the middle of my beauty sleep. I suppose it's your time to sleep now." At death... "You can think you can escape the tyranny of Tiamat?? No one can! Not even me."

    (Young Black Dracolich) -

LAIR ACTIONS: On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
- A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
- Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagicallight can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

Any kobold alive and monitoring the party immediately notifies other kobolds who begin creating much easier to navigate traps. Additionally, there are temples devoted to Kurtulmak and Tiamat, merchanting areas, blacksmith workshops, and living areas with collections of tools and wires. The lower levels are inclined upward, eventually leading to a smaller series of tunnels that lead to various places within the Bronze Citadel. One of these tunnels is large enough for Medium/Large creatures.

Kobolds can be seen making traps, utilizing pulley systems, weighing rocks, ironworking and more. One kobold appears to be testing a recently designed trap where he it over a glyph which triggers and starts a fire that heats the tea pot which blows steam which turns the fan that powers the crank that raises a dagger which cuts a cord that holds a stone which falls. Another kobold, the designer (Rube Goldberg) is monitoring and taking notes.

Lower levels of the kobold lair lead to collapsing edges, often over pits of lava or heavily mined out abysses - drops that could easily lead to a player's death (50ft +).

### The Bronze Citadel

"Through the streets, shifting pass the mouths of the alleyway, grotesque masses of flesh accompanied by the crackling, clashes of whips against their skins. Two boned devil-like creatures slowly pass, snapping their spined whips against the wailing globs of flesh, as you hide in the shadows, holding your breath. Getting a closer look, the flesh-like creatures appear to have faces, though solidifed after melting from the impassible temperatures of the hells, their faces locked with open mouths as if screaming in agony."

You pass a number of barracks where militaristic soldiers, mercenaries, perhaps even body-guards train against themselves in combat using miscellaneous weapons, spurred on by much larger hellfire knights, wielding inflamed weapons, swords, battleaxes and of course, flails. The soldiers are headless, acting as though uniformly, yet still battling to the death, fearlessly obeying the commanding officers.

The players will need proper documentation for safe passage (a Rite of Passage) through the Nine Hells. Neither the players nor the NPCs are aware of this requirement. A Rite of Passage ensures the holders legal protection and often a chain of security (literally a chain, they will be accompanied by 2 chained devils and a slavemaster). If players are murdered while holding their certification, entitled A Rite of Passage, their souls are collected (at the Bronze Citadel) for the purpose of resurrection (rather than continuous torture). In order to acquire said documentation, they must be escorted through the Bronze Citadel barracks to either a lieutenant in command or Bel himself to plead their case.

The Bronze Citadel is the seat of Bel’s power. It is a mighty fortress of fourteen concentric rings, each studded with forbidding towers and infernal war machines. Thousands of spined devils, bearded devils, and legion devils are housed in its vast barracks. Barbaric and milartistic, the Citadel is functionally, solely, a war-city. Any hope of finding lodging, entertainment, even a market district or temples of worship should be lost upon entering the Citadel. Despite being a war-city, there are no medical facilities - it is assumed a dying troop should be left to die on the battlefield with no assistance - they served their duty, but clearly are not fit for war. These accomodations may exist in the City of Dis, but not here. The city is a massive hill, rising unequivocally level by level, though the streets are entirely disconnected between levels - it is a wonder that any form of vehicle transportation could exist in the city. However, their is an underground - a once engineered systems of sewers and tunnels, for the purpose of escorting discarded corpses and flesh away from the city open as large sewer pipes into the streets, overflooded with corpses.

Through clever manipulation and perhaps illususory documentation, the players may be able to seek the counsel of Bel, the militaristic warlord of Avernus, though not its ruler, that would be Zariel. During the Blood Wars, Bel proved inadequate in marshaling and launches offensive forces against the encroaching demons. As a result, Bel was reassigned as an advisor to Zariel who oversee continuing war efforts.

### The River Styx

The players will need a guide for traversing the planes of Baator. One obvious option is caraveening the River Styx. Alternatively, in a nearby town of Avernus, players can find a local inn and question the bartender (or locals) for information on traveling the hells. Another option is impersonating militaristic officials, whom often use the River Styx as a means of quick travel. When encountered, the river is a deep, swift, and unfordable torrent. Those who touched or drank from the Styx would forget their past lives completely for a while, sometimes permanently. Simple exposure to the water of the Styx can cause temporary disillusions and rob intelligent creatures of memories (DC 15 INT). It races in a reckless black torrent through steep gorges in Avernus before disappearing into a fuming cavern and plummeting down to the fetid marshes of Minauros. Slow and sluggish at that point, it wanders on a long, dark journey before emerging again in the icy sea of Stygia. The Styx then flows through Malbolge and Maladomini before it ends in the great glaciers of Cania, missing only Dis, Phlegethos, and Nessus in its travels.

A major altraloth is Charon, the boatman of the River of Blood, who ferries souls down the River for a steep price** (a magical item, a silk pouch containing 100pp, or two gems worth 500gp + each). The River of Blood links the topmost layers of the Fiendish Planes, and it branches can be found anywhere from the Nine Hells to the Abyss. When encountered, the River is a deep, swift, and unfordable torrent. Those who touch or drink from the River will forget their past lives completely.

A number of other passengers appear to be disboarding Charon's skiff at the port, this is apparently their destination, interestingly. One figure (Jack Scrimshaw - Glamour Bard), sort of in the shadows, hangs at the corner of the boat. His appearance seems roughly human-like, though his face is covered by a black hat, with a large rim. His attire, though a bit shabby and worn, is luxurious, very much in contrast to the surrounding crowd soulessly wandering the docks and alleyways. A jean-like tuxito on top of a collared, puffy white shirt. A fiddle rests at his side. Lanterns perimiter the docks, bringing a subtle light to the dark harbor. Only a single lantern is actually on the boat itself, right in front, hanging on the bow, bending towards the waters.

Gates of Malsperanze: This is an archway guarded by gates of iron. It has molten runes that say: "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.” Beyond the gates is a road of skulls that leads to Dis, the second layer.

The black river is thick with the twisting and writhing bodies of the damned. They reach for you wailing for help. Theirs is an eternity in torment. As the river bends within a large canyon of razor-sharp obsidian, you see devils pouring more nude bodies into the river, stabbing at them with spears and claws, taking bites out of their flanks and letting red blood flow over their naked bodies. Within the mass of bodies through which you travel, faces seem familiar. As they call out to you, screaming for help, you find yourself drawn to pulling them from the sludge of the river regardless of the life-stealing nature of the dark waters.

If battling living beings, Charon will use Imprisonment in an attempt to trap the soul of one opponent in his phylactery, which is sealed within the vault in his lair, a temple-like, black-iced tomb located above the ferry port on the far side of the Styx. Charon casts Control Weather to calm the water in the channel he traverses across the turgid river to ensure he never has problems. He can also use Chill Touch and Imprisonment, which are normally Wizard spells, and is also able to cast a special form of Regenerate that can affect only himself. There are other (sinister) ferrymen (called "marraenoloths") whom can also be persuaded for travel and are much cheaper (10pp or 50gp gems). They, on the other hand, are deceptive (40% delivered to another plane, possibly even the Abyssal planes. 50% leading the summoners to an ambush. 10% delivered to requested destination).

** Characters who offer Charon an appropriate bribe and make a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) ability check can convince him to transport their party across the river. Valuables worth at least 100 gp per character must be offered and if a bribe worth at least 1,000 gp total is made then the check will be at advantage. If a magic item is offered then the check will be made at advantage and the DC will be lowered by 1 for every 1,000 gp value of the item. Characters who can channel positive energy (e.g., Clerics, Paladins) may attempt to make a DC 20 Charisma (Intimidate) check against Charon and, if successful, he will agree to transport them. Likewise, if a character successfully turns Charon, he will be cowed and can be ordered to carry characters to the other side of the Styx. If any such attempt fails, Charon will become infuriated and attack those attempting to bend him to their will. Alternatively, players can investigate nearby towns for specialists (often cultists) who can appropriately forge legal documentation for traversing the planes of Baator.

Feeblemind - You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them. At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends. The spell can also be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish.

## Styx - through the Marshes of Minauros

As the players enter the marshlands of Minauros, the ferryman directs the vessel into the mouth of a illuminated cavern. Patches of tightly laced moss cling to the ceilings, puling with an eerie glow. The stench of a several decaying corpses attached to a large budding, vinelike plant resides in the center of stream you are following. Orange and green butterflies linger along the patches of moss near the waters. The skeletal remains of a recently deceased devil floats along banks near the butterflies, adorned with arcanist robes. Enlarged, hairy spiders with an electrical energy have intricately webbed the ceiling of the caverns. Any type of magic casting immediately results in a roll for initiative with 2 Chelicerae dive-bombing the casters and party. Any pre-existing wounds attracts the Death Butterflies, which surround and blind the wounded.

## Malbolge - The Final Encounter

Malbolge is described in detail in the Planes book.

The premise of this campaign is another scheme of Moloch, a powerful archdevil that was exiled from the Nine Hells, residing in Sigil, the City of Doors. He was the original ruler of Malbolge, though when he took the Hag Countess, Malagard, as an advisor, he was manipulated to direct his attention to topple Asmodeus. By removing Cerberus from the plane, via a collar of True Polymorph and a Greater Summon Familiar spell cast by a naive child on the Material Plane, Moloch began a takeover of Malbolge, a secretive encounter of forces collected over several generations, finally gathering at the entrance to the plane.

The players will arrive in the midst of a war between the Moloch and Glasya - Glasya, confidently residing upon the throne, not even giving Moloch's forces her attention, but rather putting this burden on her legion of succubii. Glasya is unaware of her missing pet, who has acted as the gaurdian of the layer, which gives Moloch the upper advantage. The powerful enchantment placed on the collar, however, can only be removed by a very powerful Disenchantment spell cast by a impossibly skilled archmage (such as Glasya) or through a wish spell, which can be granted by any archdevil, though generally with a number of contract stipulations.

**Background: Glasya**

Glasya is the ruler of the 6th Layer of Hell (Malbolge) and is the daughter of Asmodious. Before her rise to reign, in replacement of the previous ruler, the Hag Countess (a trusted advisor of the previous ruler, Moloch). The Hag Countess's stronghold is the core of a mountainsized boulder that perpetually rolls down Malbolge's slopes. Once Glasya killed the Hag Countess and took over, the corpse of the Hag (now petrified -- large layers of stones) became the throne room of Glasya. Glasya recruits young adults, full of life and vigor, curious and willing to experiment. For now, it is their duty to recruit new members, but they suspect something new is imminent and wait with bated breath to receive their next instructions.

"Want you do me, just one little favor, and take my beloved over to the River Styx? He is supposed to be protecting the border, and I just can't imagine what could possibly be going on now that he's not there. And of course, I'll reward you; Your recruitment process will go much easier than as for the rest of them."

**Bakground: Nine Layers of Hell**

1st: Avernus, the fiery plains; Thoughts of evil unacted upon and Lust

2nd: Dis, the Iron City; crimes of self-Indulgence and Gluttony

3rd: Minauros, the icy swamp; crimes of Greed

4th: Phelegothos, the river of fire; crimes of Violence

5th: Stygia, the sea of ice; crimes of Anger and hatred

6th: Malbolge, the boulder-strewn ravine; crimes of Heresy

7th: Maladomini, the burnt-out ruins; crimes of Fraud

8th: Caina, the realm of glaciers; crimes of Treachery and betrayal

9th: Nessus, the crater at evil's heart; all evils, of the worst sort

**Malbolge**

The sixth layer of the Nine Hells is an endless rocky slope. Cascades of boulders are frequent, pulping anything in their path. Above, the sky boils with leprous colors. The devils on this layer take shelter in copper-clad fortresses, designed to channel and deflect the frequent rock-flows. However, nothing can withstand the worst of the avalanches. The rocky slopes of Malbolge are like Gehenna's, and a Climb check is required to move around on Malbolge's surface. See Falling on Gehenna, earlier in this chapter, for a list of Climb DCs and the consequences of failure. Maggoth Thyg: Rumors describe ancient places built underneath the slopes of Malbolge. Below the hellish rock and stone, creatures older than the devils themselves—the ancient baatorians—might still roam. A certain hard-to-find defile leads to a cavern whose walls glow with a brain-numbing, grayish light. Boulder falls often clog the defile, but somehow the cavern is reopened time and again. Devils sent by the Lord of the Sixth to investigate have never returned. Terrible cries sometimes issue forth from the cavern, echoing across Malbolge's slopes. Strangely, petitioners on this level cannot hear the cries. But devils can, and the sound is innately terrifying to them.

Creatures:

- Astropal Scion - godly, undead abominations resembling a fetus created from a god's death
- Lodestone Marauder (see below)

**The 9 Archdevils of Hell**

**Bel, the Warlord of Avernus**

Bel is a former pit fiend of great power who controls Avernus. He resides in his personal fortress in the center of the Bronze Citadel. As well as being Lord of the First layer of Hell, Bel is lead general in the Blood War- an endless war between demons and devils. He betrayed his mistress and former Lord of the First, Zariel, in order to gain his current position.

**Zariel, the previous Archduchess of Avernus**

Once favored by Asmodeus, Zariel sided against him in the Reckoning of Hell. She was overthrown when Bel, the leader of her military forces, turned against her and sided with Asmodeus. Bel was installed as Lord of the First in her stead.

**Dispater, the Archduke of Dis**

Dispater is an archdevil of the Nine Hells, and the Lord of the Iron City of Dis. Paranoid and reclusive, he no longer leaves his inner sanctum. He is always stoic, emotionless, and expressionless. He remains this way constantly even in the heat of battle. Dispater is the very definition of caution. He is vigilant beyond compare, weaving a web of impenetrable defenses around himself and his holdings, constantly afraid of losing his position of power. Due to his fear, he clung to Asmodeus's side during the reckoning.

**Mammon, the Prince of Erebus**

Mammon is the archduke of Erebus, the third layer of the Nine Hells, and the patron of greed and lust. Despised by his peers, no one trusts Mammon thanks to his record for duplicity. During the reckoning he origionally sided with the rebellion, but eventually betrayed them for money offered by Asmodeus. Condemned to his stinking mire, he dreams of one day gathering all riches in the universe, with Glasya, his crush and Asmodeus's daughter, at his feet. Fully aware that he has exhausted any hopes of gaining allies from the other Lords, he has abandoned the political maneuverings in Hell and resorted to gaining material wealth.

**Fierna and Belial Archdukes of Phlegethos**

In name, Fierna rules Phlegethos, commanding the fiery layer from her palace of rock and magma. In truth, her brother, Belial, is the power behind the throne. Sequestered away in the central Hall of One Thousand Sighs and Screams, he advises his sister in the arts of love and pain, taking a personal hand in ensuring she learns all there is to know. Up until now, the situation suited Fierna just fine. But thanks to her flowering relationship with Glasya, she has become more interested in taking Phlegethos in more than just name. No longer is she content to sit idly by and let her brother make the decisions. Belial was relieved of his position of Archduke of Phlegethos when he sided against Asmodeus in the Reckoning, but quickly pleaded for mercy when they lost. Together Fierna and Belial represent the patrons of lust and pain.

**Levistus the Archduke of Stygia**

The Lord of the Fifth, Levistus, rules over the layer of Stygia, the patron of lies and betrayal. At the moment, he is visible only as a black speck a quarter-mile within a towering mountain of dark ice that floats at random about Stygia. Asmodeus imprisoned Levistus in ice for a past betrayal, namely attempting to ravish and eventually killing Bensozia, consort to Asmodeus and mother to Glasya. Levistus was, for millennia, trapped and unable to act within his icy tomb, but recently Asmodeus made an inexplicable gesture to his lover’s murderer, displacing the formerly loyal ruler of Stygia, Geryon, and passing the position over to the frozen prince, though leaving him trapped within his tomb. Levistus now rules his layer via telepathic instructions issued to his many courtiers.

**Glasya, the Archduchess of Malbolge and daughter of Asmodeus**

Lord of the Sixth layer, Glasya is a Princess of the Nine Hells. She is noted as one of the most powerful and influential of the female devils and for being the daughter of Asmodeus. She is a minor patron of corruption, growth, and agony. Glasya was once Mammon's favoured consort. However, this relationship changed when Mammon sided against Asmodeus in the Reckoning. Mammon slunk back to the Lord of Hell and Glasya was taken from him and appointed Queen of the erinyes, a position she absolutely despised. Since becoming Lord of the Sixth, Glasya has had a thriving friendship with Fierna, which frightens Belial as his 'loving' sister may believe she no longer has any use for her manipulative brother.

**Baalzebul Archduke of Maladomini**

Baalzebul is the lord of Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells, and one of the most powerful archdevils. Formerly a celestial archon known as Triel. He was a perfectionist, and this served him well as he climbed the ranks of devilhood. Now he is called the Slug Lord, which refers to the form he was cursed with after he led the revolt against asmodeus in the Reckoning of Hell. To punish Baalzebul for his insubordination, Asmodeus changed his formerly angelic form into a melted, sluglike one. Suffering from depression, Baalzebul's perfectionism has lapsed, and his layer of hell shows the signs

**Mesistopheles, The Archduke of Cania**

Mephistopheles is Lord of the 8th layer of Cania, and acts as right hand man of Asmodeus. He is something of a walking contradiction. Unstable and thoroughly wicked, he presents multiple faces to those he meets. On the one hand, he can be charming, erudite, and civil. But beneath the veneer of respectability is a vicious temper and unchecked ambition. He is patient and cunning, yet when alone, he flies into a fury, screaming and shrieking, tearing at his skin and destroying everything around him in a thunderous explosion of hellfire and devastating magic. His ultimate goal in life is to rule in the 9 Hells but he wants to do it alone so for now he sucks up to Asmodeus.

**Asmodeus Overlord of Hell, Archduke of Nessus**

Asmodeus is the cruel leader of the 9 hells, representing evil in its purest form. In order to maintain fear and order, he requires monthly one on one sessions that he calls "Detention" where he tortures the fear into them. He maintains multiple other tactics to maintain his control over the archdevils, including using his "pet" bird Iris. Iris is a colossal firebird that can easily kill the Archdevils at Asmodeus's command. Asmodeus was chief of these angels. However, due to his dedication to law no matter what, he began using increasingly brutal methods in dealing with them. He and his friends began to resemble the demons. Asmodeus knew that law demanded punishment, so he would take the souls of evil people and punish them in the gods' dwelling-places. Some gods approved of Asmodeus's methods. Some deliberately sided with him. Others spoke out against his methods. Eventually, though, the good gods prevailed and asked him to leave the heavens and take his punishment with him. Asmodeus produced the Pact Primeval, which basically ceded Baator (then an empty plane, depending on the source---Asmodeus seemed to have wiped out the original inhabitants in some accounts---all agree on it being empty, though) to him and established him as jail warden of the entire cosmos. He would be allowed to continue his (very necessary) work there, away from the gods.

**Monsters**

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**HULKING WELP**

Armor Class 15, Hit Points 94, Speed 40 ft.

[Untitled](The%20Lost%20Puppy%206a36a1de1013415499fd3f5f1acadd53/Untitled%20Database%206356c637356045389f0d0d7021c9036c.csv)

Damage Resistances bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons

Poor Senses. A hulking whelp has poor hearing and is nearsighted. It can see in normal or dim light up to 30 feet and hear sounds from up to 60 feet away.

**Unleashed Emotion**. When a hulking whelp feels threatened— it’s touched, intimidated, cornered, attacked, or even just if a stranger moves adjacent to the whelp—it immediately grows from size Small to Huge as a reaction. If the whelp was attacked, this reaction occurs after the attack is made but before damage is done. Nearby creatures and objects are pushed to the nearest available space and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Weapons, armor, and other objects worn or carried by the hulking whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn’t much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it’s affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn’t entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction. Under the wrong conditions, such as in a populated area, a hulking whelp’s Unleashed Emotion can last for days.

**Multiattack**. The hulking whelp makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Quick Step.** (reaction) A hulking whelp can move 20 feet as a reaction when it is attacked.

### Player Death

According to the Fiendish Code II, the soul's destination follows this order :

- You materialize on a blood-soaked rock protruding from the River Styx in an area known as the Shelves of Despond on the first layer of Hell.
- Almost every soul shell has a special mark on them to denote that a particular devil has claimed their soul.
- Bearded devils, soul collectors on boats, put the new arrivals in cages. The cages are put in carts and shipped off to a torture station.
- You are brought to a torture station and go through a process that peels off your individuality. A portion of your essence flows to a prominent devil who has staked a claim on you.
- You are thrown in the Maggot Pit where you are reborn as a mindless lemure.
