The warforged raptor is a construct of battle, designed by House Cannith for sale to those nations who required a counter to the Aundairian dragonhawks and Thrane wyverns. Although only moderately suited to combat against other aerial foes, the raptors are deadly when deployed against ground-based targets.

Four rounded leathery wings hold an enormous metallic body aloft. In silhouette, you could almost mistake the creature for a giant dragonfly, but only on a first, casual glance. Where you might expect a squat insectoid head, it boasts instead a long segmented neck, atop which is a featureless mass angled like a great hawk’s beak or the striking end of a heavy pick. Rather than the graceful tail of a dragonfly, it sprouts a fan of metal, almost like tail feathers of burnished mithral. (Warforged Raptor, Forge of War 157)
