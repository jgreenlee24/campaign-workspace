# Ulina Pyranim

Affiliation: Morgrave University
Description: Ulina is a student at Morgrave University studying Ancient Giantish language and culture. She isn't particularly noteworthy, except that she's been constantly plastering "looking for Xen'drik adventuring party" notices in every tavern and guildhall in Sharn for years now, so she's become a running joke to the Watch who amuse themselves by reading over her latest postings whenever they crop up.
Location: Breland, Sharn
Race: Halfling
Role: Researcher, Student
