# Austasia ir'Wynarn

Affiliation: Royal Family
Description: Austasia Ir'Wynarn is the adolescent daughter of https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Aurad_ir%27Wynarn and his wife Wrenya. She is also the niece of https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_Aurala_ir%27Wynarn, and thus part of the https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Aundairian_Royal_Family. She has four siblings. Dreaming of becoming a great explorer, and encouraged by her rascally cousin Princess Corrine, Austasia runs away to pursue her dreams. She leaves https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Fairhold, possibly with Corrine, disguises herself and attempts to travel to https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Sharn. Austasia shows promise and may be hero material one day, but she's still too young and isn't ready.
