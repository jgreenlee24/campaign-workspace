# Aldric d'Cannith

Affiliation: House Cannith
Capabilities: Aldric is a prodigy when it comes to crafting and using potions and wands, and was the youngest person chosen to head any branch of the Fabricators Guild since before the Last War. He studies arcane magic as well, specializing in spells for the creation, shaping, and animation of matter.
Description: The 37-year-old arcanist is the nephew of famed artificer Aaren d'Cannith, the man who discovered how to grant sapience to warforged, and the second cousin of Baron Merrix d'Cannith. He has spent much of his time with the Twelve researching everything he can about warforged, making him a person of interest to the intelligence agencies of every nation of Khorvaire, since they all keep tabs on anyone who might be inclined to break the Treaty of Thronehold's prohibition on the creation of warforged either accidentally or intentionally.
