# Toahil Ziventi

Affiliation: Morgrave University
Capabilities: Toahil has the art of elemental binding down to a science and is one of the most efficient crafters in the binders' ranks. He specializes in air and water elementals (and their variations, such as ice paraelementals and lightning quasielementals) to the point that much of his body has been replaced by such elemental matter, and he can summon powerful elementals with a thought. His expertise with elemental grafting extends to construction of warforged grafts and elemental arms and armaments, and between that and his combat experience as a mercenary during the Last War he has a good amount of weapons training as well.
Description: The 223-year-old gnome is, to the public, a beloved professor who has taught several generations of Breland's best and brightest at Morgrave University. Students love to hear the exciting tales of his youth spent relic-hunting in Xen'drik that he tells to illustrate almost every lesson, and students with little to no interest in either history or magic will take his classes just for that tendency. Toahil only teaches one or two small and specialized classes each term; during his youth the rest of his time was spent on expeditions, and now that he's gained tenure most of his time is spent in research. What most don't know, however, is that his true specialization lies in elemental binding. He is one of the premier elemental binders in Zilargo, and more than one sabbatical taken during the Last War for a "Xen'drik expedition" was in fact dedicated to optimizing magical crafting procedures to allow Zilargo to meet wartime production quotas for its clients. He literally wrote the book on much of modern elemental theory--quite a few books, actually--and every Zilargo-trained artificer knows his name.
