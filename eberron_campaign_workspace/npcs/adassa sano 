# Adassa Sano

Affiliation: Fangli Towger, House Cannith, Snorri d'Kundarak
Description: "The Cannith grift": Fangli Towger was an easy target when Adassa Sano, Tabak Verna, & Novalie Marthea (House Cannith) arrived at his homestead in the Demon Wastes. Like butcher's dogs, they almost slobbered in glee, almost fell over themselves with promises they could deliver the Ghash'kaala not just sanctifiable warforged but enough plans to construct these machinations themselves in exchange for carts of endless thousands of gold in fortune. One year later, Fangli received a parcel: a metal doll with a lacquered smile. Since Fangli's fall, Snorri holds a grudge against those who betrayed his comrade, inscribing their names in a Book of Grudges in blood â€” a personal vow of vengeance.
