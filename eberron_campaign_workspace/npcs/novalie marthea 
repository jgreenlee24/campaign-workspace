Description: See description for Adassa Sano. Novalie, a fallen aasimar, empowered with the divinity of the Flame coursing her veins, informed Adassa initially of the "simple-minded" folk in the Wastes, the heretics of her faith. She intended for the provisioned warforged to be fulfilled in due time, but time allowed Adassa to persuade her accomplice to disavow herself from that initial promise.
