### Baron Jorash Mror'anon

"Well... what have we here?... Now should I do with a bunch of intruders? Eh?", with a big gruesome smile exposing his grid of silver teeth.

- "What business do you have here?"

- The dwarf strokes a steel predator as a fond pet (Appendix A). Two warforged guards equipped with intricate firearms defend the two exits branching from this central laboratory. A gold chestplate and greaves mark one of the warforged guards as the ranking officer (Sentinel). A woman (Adassa Sano) stands attentively monitoring the players, especially magic users. She casts counterspell at any indication of spellcasting. She is eventually interrupted by her daughter (who lives with her), carrying a metallic doll with a lacquered grimace across its face.

- Regarding the fallen construct (Arkenen), the dwarf comments, "He can always be repaired."
