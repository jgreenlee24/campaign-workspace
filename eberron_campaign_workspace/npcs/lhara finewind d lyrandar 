- *"To sugarcoat this operation would be foolish, a few months ago a standard exposition into the Mournlands set one of our vessels out with a crew to extract a few objects... the ship descended too low when they went out to extract the few survivors and it crashed. We thought it was lost until two days ago when a remote distress signal with the ship's unique identifier was discovered."*
