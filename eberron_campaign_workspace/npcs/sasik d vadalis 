# Sasik d'Vadalis

Affiliation: House Vadalis, Royal Family
Description: Older brother to the current patriarch of https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Vadalis, Baron https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Dalin_d%27Vadalis, Sasik gave up his seat of power within the house when he chose to marry https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Aurala_ir%27Wynarn of https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/Aundair. Despite this he remains a member of the family if not an official member of the house and he and his brother still share close, friendly ties. His remaining ties to the house make Vadalis competitors nervous about what advantages they might be gaining through Vadalis's dealings with Aundair.
