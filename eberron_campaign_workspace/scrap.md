-- These constructs, though built to operate without a crew, are often built to carry wizards, artificers, and magewrights. For these reasons, these constructs are largely hollow on the inside supporting ladders, control rooms, storage rooms, arbalast turrets, and observation docks.

- Access points are limited (hatches along the backside). These access points are enchanted by Kundarak employees (*arcane lock*).
- Control Panel: 6 active glyphs, 4 inactive glyphs
- Within the construct are various undead, the corpses of the original inhabitants reanimated by the mists.
- The colossus operates via a network of nodes. The network converges at one place, where the captain could stand and control the colossus’s every movement through the use of a mithral helmet with hundreds of semi-organic tendril-wires attached. By way of the central master *[docent](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/docent)* — a true docent recovered from Xen’drik — the whole network fed information back to the operator. Several smaller “hubs” of the network gave other operators access to the relevant parts of that information and enabled them to control parts of the colossus as well.
- “Artorok” (Colossus WX-73) sits at the bottom of Lake Cyre amid the scaffolding of a sunken House Cannith workshop, flooded but otherwise intact. The players can see the scaffolding of the workshop, explore, and find a flooded, walking dungeon.
- “Norr” (Colossus WX-5) is slumped amid the ruins of Metrol, the former capital of Cyre.
- **Treasure:**
    - *Headband of Intellect*, *Wand of the War Mage*,
    - *Gunpowder (Powder horn), Blunderbuss (damaged),*
    - *Horn of Blasting,*
