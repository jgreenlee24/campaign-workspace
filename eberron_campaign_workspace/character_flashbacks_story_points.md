## Karlyn Thorne ~ *The Demons Within*

---

Episode 1 **- A Simple Greeting from your friend, the Keeper**

*In this short narrative, Karlyn explores the Archives of the Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead, controlled by the worshippers of the Sovereign Host in search for a means to resurrect her brother. At the end she meets the Traveler, in the voice of a jester.* 

Your life has been marked only by the deaths of those you have loved. Grief consumed your thoughts, despair and hopelessness your new companions. You feel like you are now only but a shell of your former self. Your last memory of your brother is not pleasant - a succumbing poison draining and weakening him slowly until he finally helplessly dropped; healing magic proving ineffective. You think of his body, among the others aboard, their lives lost that day in a tragic end. The Chronicle newspaper, the following eve, reported the Silver Line lightning rail derailing into the Dagger River, submerging and drowning all remaining inhabitants. These dreaded thoughts you try to force out of your mind, only to find them lingering on, returning every time you close your eyes. "Death. That is my only freedom", your mind suggests.

The poison was bitter in your mouth but filled your nose with sweet scent as you swallowed it down. "Now I am truly amongst the dead", you think and replaced the drained chalice on the dais before the iron crone.

“Thank you, Karlyn,” the crone said and raised a calliper-braced arm to show a dragonmark glowing with a pale blue light on her withered palm enclosing star haloed chalice of the Dark Six. You have been permitted to pass far below the upper chambers and courts of the Church of the Wyrm Ascendant, past the great seal of the god Onatar, the Sovereign of metal and smith, depicting his triumph over the wyrm where none save a bearer of the seal might enter, and far below into the catacombs of the outer archive where the lesser secrets were kept. Even in those outer levels, your steps are followed the tread of sentinel servitors, their  execution protocols forever vigilant. Yet as you approach the torch framed doors to this deepest oubliette and see the alcove of the crone who watches over it, you feel an unaccustomed dread rise in his well-trained mind: 

“You have the time until the sand runs out,” said the crone, up-turning two iron-bound hourglasses. The crone handing one to you, placing the other on the table next to the emptied poison chalice. “You must return and drink my second draught if you do not wish your brother to remain amongst the dead,” the crone explained with some relish, the crystals of the timer reflecting the cold blue of her eyes. She smiled, no mere servitor this one, something far older, far worse.

You nod and the door to the inner archive opened with radiance like a bronze flower. A hiss of gas sounds to your right, igniting a now burning torch. You gaze up to the elongated mechanical form looming above you. Its face like dead, waxen skin stretched over brass.

“What do you seek?” it said in a voice as dead and dry as its face.
“Your concern is this,” the voice speaks, projecting an illusion of an altar. 

In your bag, you have contained the ashes of Barden. You owe a great debt to a woman named Marr for its retrieval from the House of Dust and Ash, a corpse collection station in Sharn. You only hoped it was worth the blood paid for it. The curator was still for a second and then its frame folded with a clicking of clockwork, until its dead face was level with the object.

“There are several connections, many possible references and significances. I can only show you where, you must search for yourself.” Suddenly, extending to its full, unnatural height, the curator turned and moved away into the dark. You follow its soundless, slow flight to a waiting elevator cage. They descended through chambers surrounded by the openings of dark ended corridors. It is like descending down the barrel of a clockwork gun, or the stilled mechanism of an ancient lock. All around are books and tomes, secrets stacked on secrets, overlaid with lies and conjecture—heresies and terrible truths all imprisoned here in darkness. At last the cage shuddered to a halt in a pool of waning light. At the edge of sight you see pale surfaces, hints of form and structure slowly coming into focus as his your adjust to the gloom. Cold feminine features cast in moon-white stone gazed down at you, robed arms crossed in the sign of the Keeper over the soft carved edges of her robes. 

Gazing back into the still face, vast and magnificent, you realise who she is, whose tomb he looked at—Cassilda Cognos, a dead legend, a lich, standing guard over the oldest and most dangerous section of the Sovereign's archive, serving in death the Order she had helped to found in life. The cage door hinged open and the curator motions you towards the darkness beyond, passing a gas-torch into his hand. “Go. I cannot pass here,” said its dead lips, and then after a pause, “You must return before the sand ends or you will remain there waiting to join the dead.” 

You step out and the cage ascended into the darkness above. Alone now, he could feel it around him, the weight of doom, of fragments of future written and atrocities past, all waiting to be reassembled in some dark configuration. But where to begin? Less than an hour’s time bought for so many lives, I dare not waste it! With each beat of his heart he was closer to death and here simple fascination or curiosity itself could kill.  As you step into the darkness, his torch aloft, he heard a voice, strange and mocking. It echoed as if from a great distance above, yet at the same time, sounded like a whisper at his ear. The curator, the crone or something else? In a joyful, satyrical voice you hear, “You will find what you seek, Karlyn. You are here. You have always been here.”

**Episode 1 - Awake**

In your slumber, you discover yourself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extends around you in monotonous undulations as far as you can see. An unrecognizable ship rests assuredly grounded some distance away. Ruined structures of a once thriving metropolis appear and vanish in the thrashing waves. Water suddenly rushes about you, you fight against the engulfing current. As you turn toward the source of this raging waterfall, a blinding light shines on a reflective, scaly surface, barely concealing rows of shark-like, elongated fangs. Then something under the water creeps against your skin. A cold, slimy feeling, an applied pressure inches slowly wrapping your body, pulling you down into the torrential wake until finally your neck tightens. You awaken, gasping for air in a cold sweat.

**Episode 2 - Hell is Empty**

As you fall asleep your mind drifting you feel yourself covered with a sudden weight like a heavy winter coat layer upon layer. You open your eyes see darkness, bubbles of moonlight rising slowly to the surface. Your throat fills suddenly with water. 

You are nearly to the shore, when lightning again splits the sky. It cracks, lighting up the dreaded storm clouds above. On the shore, a cloaked figure bends over a crate, hurling its contents onto the beach. When at last you reach the beach, the light of the figure's lantern reveals their spectral mount. As you rush forward to the beach, the mount takes off, galloping at a speed impossible for a flesh and blood horse. Unfortunately, there is no time to worry about the rider. Survivors are crawling onto the beach, and others are still floundering in the surf. Stepping out of the ocean are a gaggle of fish walking on two legs. When the first one reaches a struggling survivor, it drives its spear through the swimmer and then continues its advance.

**Episode 1: A Chance to be Free**

And there... she is. Kind of in a corner alone, staring out a nearby window at the fields below. She is wearing a beautiful blue gown, trimmed with ribbons of silver, the colors of Aundair, though the brooch around her neck and her eyes are of a deep, dark emerald. Her auburn hair, kind of in a mess, is braided nicely. As you approach, she hears your steps, turning with anxious breath in concern, until she notices it's just you and a grin creeps across her face. "Let's get away, from here, from all this... My father tells me I am soon to be betrothed."

**Episode 1: A Meeting with the Magistrate**

"This is the day!", your mind squeals with youthful glee as you eagerly march your way up the grandiose stairs of the Sivis Reporium of Korranberg. A gentle-gnome in a well-trimmed suit and flourished white collar escorts you into a waiting room outside the Magistrate's office where a surreal, natural display of assorted fruits hangs to the side over a marble countertop. An herbal tea thermos rests beside a set of small porcelain plates and teacups... "Dorrias", you hear in your mind, "you may come in now." You enter to see an old gnomish woman, her face marked with a a dragonmark. Her demeanor is warm and welcoming, but her constant stare is cold as frost.

"What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient... highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere. The pen is mightier than the sword, they say. A few simple words can stop wars, secure peace for centuries, or otherwise devastate national reputations. A simple idea can manifest as a nation's most reputable source of gross revenue and build a vast capitalist infrastructure upon which an a populace can enjoy economic prosperity and favoritism." ~ **Doyenee Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis**
