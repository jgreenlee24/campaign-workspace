**The Clans**

**Mroranon**-- Allied with Breland as they supply a lot of iron and industrial material.

**Droranath**--Barbarians, fighters, and martial classes. A poorer clan, it supplies mercenaries to House Denieth.

**Kolkarun**--A shifty clan that loves to make alliances and then turn on them. Allied with Aundair, Karrnath, Zilargo, Talanentia Plains tribes, and the Emerald Claw.

**Kundarak**--the Dragonmarked Houses in general. Kundark works in the shadows to manipulate the Holds.

**Laranak** and **Londurak**--Clans with the most magic: lots of sorcerers, artificers, and wizards. Laranak has an alliance with Aundair and sends it's best to study and work in Arcanix, Passage, and Fairhaven and them comeback to the Holds to deal in magical services. Londurak has cornered the Khyber Dragonshard trade in the Holds, becoming experts in deep mining and exploration. They have a tight relationship with Zilargo and through them have learned some of the art of elemental binding, creating some of the few elemental vehicles made outside Zilargo (all under Zilargo's watch).

**Soldorak**--their power is the Aurum and they seek to displace Kundarak and Mroranon and become not just the leading clan of the Holds but also a major player in Khorvair.

**Toldorath** and **Tordannon**--Allied clans that work with the Aurum and with the Jhorash oks. They have a tentative alliance with House Thrashk, although Shadow Marcher orks have little in common with Jhorash orks and have at best been able to only recruit them into their monstrous mercenary services.
