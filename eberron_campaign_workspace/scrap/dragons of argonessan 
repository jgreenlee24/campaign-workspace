**Organizations of Argonessan**

- **The Chamber** - loose alliance, network of safe houses across Khorvaire
    - Divergent interests: recovery of artifacts, observing races, etc.
- **The Tapestry -** The Tapestry is the home base of the Chamber, although some dragons of the Vast serve in that body. In the Tapestry, dragon mystics, prophets, and sages continue their work, while their elders defend the activities of the Tapestry and the Chamber before the Conclave. Both the Eyes of Chronepsis and the wyrms of the Conclave have grave doubts about allowing dragons to intentionally interfere with the outcome of the Prophecy, and many wish to shut down these activities and force the dragons of the Chamber to rejoin the Thousand or disperse into the Vast. For now, however, the Tapestry remains a crucible for new ideas.
- **Chronepsis** - dragon deity
    - *Eyes of Chronepsis* - force of ~150 elder dragons, hand-picked by the Conclave
    - Acts as judge an executioner of any dragons that threaten the stability of Argonnessan or the Draconic Prophecy
- **The Conclave**
- **Draelus Tairn** - faction of Tarnadal elves on northern Aerenal
