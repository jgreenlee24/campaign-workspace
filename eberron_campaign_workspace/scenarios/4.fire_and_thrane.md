# Eberron 4: "Fire and Thrane"

***RECAP***

*Previously in Eberron, you arrived at the city of Vathirond, a large town on the south bank of the Brey River in Northern Breland, and settled down for a short rest in the Golden Dragon Inn. It was here that you met Snorri d'Kundarak, a dragonmarked dwarf commissioned to retrieve the stolen weapon by his House. At that time, you heard a man's scream for help coming from the gatehouse. There, you found guard bodies littering the watch tower and a trail of blood leading to the sewer systems. Bravely, you entered the gruesome tunnel to discover an undead manifestation wrapped in burial cloths. Blinded by its encompassing sandstorms and weakened by the creature's sickening plagues, Fangli and Remmy fell unconscious. Snorri managed to escape, magically sealing the exit path, sneaking back into the sewers through another entry and bravely rescuing the unconscious Fangli. But this heroic endeavor came not without the loss of Remmy, whose body turned to dust.*

*Hearing the cacophony of clanging originating from the hatch to the sewer system just outside the tavern, you, Elazra and Syndra proceeded to exit the inn, but stopped by a somewhat startled Erben. Erben requested privacy for his employer and in response, Elazra chose to charm Erben, persuading him to open the door. As you peered inside, you witnessed Roewyn convening with a dragon, speaking of prophecy and rare relics of the Great War. You regrouped outside, in the presence of a rather agitated, ancient undead. Just as Krogg brought his greataxe through the remnants of what corporeal substance remained of the undead creature, from the Vadalisan stables, Athena, Corrine's majestic gryphon, cried out in pain and ascended into the air. Without warning, a horde of ghouls broke through the south-side gates of the city followed with some delay by the ringing of the town bells. Snorri assisted the wounded Fangli in finding a local health practitioner's office for quick healing. As the ghouls ripped through the guards' protective vestments and flesh, you collectively stayed at a range, psychically taunting them and attempting an escape via Lightning Rail. Realizing you had left Captain Frederick d'Lyrander behind, Fangli, Snorri and Corrine embarked on a rescue mission to save the Captain. Fangli stormed through the inn's second floor, slamming open doors to find, not the Captain, but a familiar face, Darwin Albatross, an hobgoblin wielding a silver-tipped leather whip and bearing the insignia of the Silver Flame engraved onto the palms of his hands. Fearing for your lives, you ensured your safe departure from the town aboard a lightning rail heading toward Flamekeep, but not without the loss of a number of gnomish lives and the continuing presence of the ghouls you left alive in the city.*

***Loose Ends***

- Roewyn: explain the dragon prophecy thing on the train: "I don't know what you think you heard, but..."
- Syndra: heard the sound of squeaking on the train (a single bat, summoned by Lucan when he last took the same train)
- Erben: charmed for one hour... probably pissed off about the whole risk your life thing
- Krogg: just informed that Remmy died before leaving the town

***On the Train to Thrane***

*A human woman dressed in an almost militaristic leather uniform, embroidered with the insignia of House Orien steps into the cart. "Welcome passengers aboard the North Silver Line Express provided by House Orien. Our next stop is Aruldusk, followed by Sigilstar. Once we arrive there, there will be a short hour delay for off-boarding, on-boarding and inspections that will take about an hour. From there we will proceed to our final destination, Flamekeep. Dining services and snacks will be in the dining cart up ahead provided by House Ghallanda. Thank you for choosing House Orien." After the announcement, she proceeds pass the passengers onto the next cart to convey the information to the other passengers. Passengers on the train seem oddly nervous (because of the strange flanking pattern of the undead... undead do not normally enter via the southern gates). Seeing your armor and insignia, Fangli, an older woman on the cart appears to scowl at you for a moment, as if in absolute hatred, until your eyes meet, at which point she shys away immediately, redirecting her gaze out the window..*

Other passengers on the train:

- Father August Eseradale- pilgrim (friar) of the Silver Flame, returning from mission work in Darguun. A dark brown, leather cloak lays atop the friar's platinum silver cloths. He glumly stares out the small window beside him, gazing at the Thranish countryside. A humble silver arrowhead attached to a small chain resides on the friar's neck.
- Myrna Smyrmire, older gnomish woman, necklace of silver flame arrowhead *(as if judgmentally thinking, 'you wear the armour of the Silver Flame, yet you do not protect her people').*

**Lightning Rail Traveling Costs** (from Sigilstar)

- trip from Vathirond to Aruldusk (10hr) long rest, then to Sigilstar (5h 30m), then to Flamekeep (10h) = 25hr trip @ 21gp, 8sp 4cp

**Aruldusk**

*The city is a rather quaint tourist town whose inhabitants are mostly simple merchants or farmers. The city is known for its beautiful cathedral devoted to the Silver Flame. A trail of smoke can be seen in the distance, near a body of water that stretches out beyond one's sight. Something has been recently set ablaze. As the train comes to a graceful stop, and the doors of the cart automatically open, a couple of individuals board the vessel.*

Arriving on the train from Aruldusk:

- Emily d'Morrun (shifter/lycanthrope), handcuffed: *In 792 YK, the Silver Flame knight Jacques
d’Morrun, desperate to save his village of Nathyrr,
donned the Pelt of Thirteen Claws and tore into the ettercaps
and phase spiders swarming out of the Harrowcrowns.
Afterward, he burned the evil garment and entered a
monastery. His atonements were only partially received
by the Silver Flame, though, for his line has been periodically
cursed with lycanthropy ever since. The latest
victim is young Emily d’Morrun. The new werewolf
begs adventurers to smuggle her out of Thrane, across
Aundair, and into the Eldeen Reaches.*
- Sir Knight Vedith Darkroth - paladin of the Silver Flame. escorting Emily to be sentenced to trial and then executed by the CoSF in Flamekeep
    - seeing the PCs, he studies them for a moment, then pulls out a *speaking stone* and whispers ("I've found them").

**Sigilstar**

*As the sun sets in the horizon and blue darkness begins the envelope the evening sky, the twilight city of Sigilstar slowly begins to take the scene. The city is notable, at least among Thranes and architects, for its impressive examples of Flamic architecture. Many of the spires of the city are capped with crystal that glow with the captured light of the sun, creating a beautiful nighttime illumination across the city. Sigilstar is known for its teas, and Sigilans are known for going to the teahouses that can be found throughout the city, and where patrons can freely discuss anything, even politics and religion in ways that are practically unknown in the rest of Thrane.*

*You pass by the faded, but still glowing auras of runic inscriptions on stone blocks spelling out the name "Sigilstar" in elvish. A moment passes, as the distant city comes into immediate proximity. A singular everbright lantern casts light onto the platform, illuminating a horrid scene. The platform of this lightning rail station is covered in gore and viscera. Suddenly, the bloodied body of a half-elven man slams against the glass screens of the cart, the man screaming in agony. As the train comes to a halt, a loud clang, metal against metal echoes through the metallic cart and a low-pitched snarling can be heard coming from the cart ahead.*

*Roll initiative. Silver-eye marauder. (AC 20, 175 HP, multi-attack +11 to hit, 1d8 + 4 claw, breathe weapon 4d6 CON 16 or half)*

*PCP 15 - you can just barely make out what appears to be a cloaked figure atop the station rooftop. In the blink-of-an-eye, the figure vanishes.*

**Flamekeep**

*From afar, Flamekeep resembles a gigantic fortress enclosed by high walls, its building perched atop a rocky plinth surrounded on all sides by a water-filled crevasse. Deep within this crevasse sits the city's bustling harbor and more crowded districts. The magnificent Cathedral of the Silver Flame, its white alabaster walls agleam, surmounts the rocky plinth - a glorious beacon visible for miles in every direction. West of the Cathedral rise the slender spires of Thalingard, the ancestral home of Thrane's kings. Unlike the Cathedral, the royal palace is sculpted from gray rock and looks somewhat glum by comparison.*

Victory Week (week of 9 Barrakas): commemorates the successful conclusion of the lycanthropic purge.

Emily d'Morrun is planned to be burned with oil along with several other shifters from Aruldusk in a public place in Flamekeep.

*Note: this is outlawed by the Treaty of Thronehold, the Knights are simply "turning the other cheek"*

-- High Cardinal Krozen

-- High Cardinal and Saint Ignatius (founder of Mentor's School of Divinity in Passage, Aundair)

**NPCs**:

Jaela Daran, Keeper of the Flame (walks the halls of the Cathedral w/ Skaravojen)

*A young girl, dressed in simple gray and black clothes, walks barefoot on the marble steps of the Cathedral. She has gray eyes, short-cropped dark hair, and a ghostly white complexion. Within the Cathedral, she is rarely seen without her fearsome pet, Skaravojen, a six legged monstrosity with four horns and four eyes.*

Thomas and Emiline Cromwell - children; Knights Templar assassins;

-- instructed to kill intruders within the Cathedral

Queen Diani ir'Wynarn, (blood regent of Thrane),

*She has often been said to be a pale copy of her cousin, Queen Aurala of Aundair, whose long blonde tresses and steely gray eyes were the stuff of legend. If such aphorisms were true, then Aurala must be a veritable angel, for the woman who stands before can only be described as breathtaking. Blonde curls spill over shapely shoulders falling nearly to her waist, while eyes like Siberys shards set in alabastar studies you intently from within a perfectly-sculpted face. A soft glamerweave gown dances with shifting shades of purple and clung in all the right places, while a pendant of lavender mourn-lode sparkled provocatively from within the confines of her cleavage. Even her amused smile seems lovely, formed by sun-kissed rose lips*

*.*

-- Dzarro Silvervein, Queen's dwarven bodyguard:

*A silver-bearded warrior leaning on a massive dwarven waraxe. He wears a bejeweled eye-patch, gleaming brightly as a thousand everbright lanterns. Simple platinum pin clasped the dwarf's flowing purple cloak at his left shoulder.*

-- Captain Malik Otherro, Knight of Thrane, captain of the guard, Queen's lover

*To the left of the throne stands a knight with the Silver Flame blazoned across his breastplate, its argent fire incongruous in this castle that remained locked in the days of Thalin's reign. A silver pendant hangs on thick chain about his neck, its stylized flame proclaiming the man's faith for all to see, and the hilt of a great-sword is visible over his left shoulder.*

Minister Shadar (Argentum)

Tower: “Warforged soldier for hire. Comes with adamantine body, bastard sword, and shield. Inquire at the Rusty Anchor."

Orison: Lusef Arcarion, discharged cleric of the Silver Flame; public preacher

**Plot hooks:**

*Characters who aid the Church might also be called upon to root out evil cultists lurking in Flamekeep, slay evil monsters haunting an ancient Dhakaani ruin, rescue an abducted archbishop, investigate a foreign diplomat suspected of plotting against the Church, locate some missing missionaries in the Eldeen Reaches, recover Silver Flame relics from a ruined temple in the Mournland, or catch thieves who have stolen something precious from the tomb of one of Thrane's great leaders.*

***RECAP***

*Previous in Eberron, you continued your voyage to Flamekeep seeking the Church's assistance, perhaps their sage advice or their knowledge would aid you on your quest to capture the rogue Dark Lantern agent, Lucan Stellos. Arriving at the first waypoint, the river-bordered Aruldusk, a paladin of the Silver Flame appeared, escorting a handcuffed shifter, a woman by the name of Emily d'Morrun. At the second waypoint, the arcane city of Sigilstar, you witnessed a horrific scene - a single, faded everbright lantern casting rays onto a platform covered in gore and viscera. Upon the train's stop, the dismantled torso of a screaming humanoid slammed against the train. A metallic quadruped effusing a silver blaze of fire entered the lightning rail, but with haste you decimated the beast. In the distant horizon you spotted a cloaked figure, and at your glance, the figure vanished into the dark night. The lightning rail speedily embarked and days after you set off on your journey, you arrived at the exalted capital of Flamekeep. The magnificent Cathedral of the Silver Flame, its white alabaster walls agleam, surmounted a rocky plateau - a glorious beacon visible for miles in every direction. You climbed its steps in the heat of the day following a crowd of religious laymen. Proceeding an orchestral service, you scheduled a meeting with Father Augustine, Counselor and Bishop of International Affairs. Following this, in the central courtyard just outside, you witnessed the attempted execution of 9 shifters in honor of Victor's Day. As the central figure transformed into a lycanthropic beast, you intervened. Elazra, in hopes of protecting the cursed woman, psychically ensnared the guards, dazing them with hypnotic fey lights. But Fangli and Snorri broke their peace-ties, setting out to destroy the beast, protecting the public. As the lycanthrope breathed her last, she dug into the flesh of Fangli who wrestled her down to its grave. One guard, particularly perceptive and insightful, called out Elazra and Snorri and under this guard's command, they were arrested for their actions.*

*Once again, as you ascend the lengthy staircases that ajoin at the summited Cathedral of the Silver Flame, from these heights you can see ruined gray walls peeking over a rolling fog that permeates the city's reach. The desolate, very distant city is situated atop an escarpment that forms the base of what locals call "The Arrow", a low-lying spit of land jutting north into Scions Sound.*
