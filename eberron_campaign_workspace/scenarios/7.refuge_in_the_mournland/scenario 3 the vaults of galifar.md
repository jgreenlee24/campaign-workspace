# Scenario 3: The Vaults of Galifar

TODO: Take inspiration from either a Warhammer 40k module or Shadowrun

**TODO: replace the PCs character icons with tokens. It'll be much easier, trust me.**

Some of the vaults are used as armories and weapon arsenals that contain military wonders and magnificent examples of both mundane craftsmanship and magical potency. The vaults below also serve as a head quarters for Kundarak operations. Kundarake conclaves often overtook existing underground civilizations and establishments (such as mining systems).

TODO: Focus on creating roleplay moments; assign tasks to certain characters, etc. (reread convo w/ James)

"We are talking forbiddance effects all over the place, surrounded on all sides by lead plating protected on all sides by guards with see invisibility and some people with true seeing for good measure, patrolling earth elementals (probably lots of archers with true strike too). Teams of casters cast divination every day to find a hint of a chance of trouble in the next week."

Fratzul provides three party members a *Bottled Breath* and warns the party members of the toxic environment of the mines.

Vault of Galifar (heist) - There's probably some great stuff in the Eberron Mournand Modules.

Perhaps have Cardinal Krozen discover the airship during this time. (Consider that the party abandoned an encampment of refugees, mostly children, on a ship with little piloting experience and with minimum viable security). Dorrias receives a message via *sending stone*, an obvious sound of concern in his voice. "Just wanted to check on how everything is going down there... Estimated time of return? ... * a short pause * We've got company." Dorrias will have one charge of the paired *sending stone* to send a short response.

### Section A. Entrance

Outside of the all-protective enclosures built to house the miners, The Vaults of Old Cyre are little more than a hellish wasteland. Even before its great hive spires and the fires of industry blackened the sky, Metrol was never a hospitable home. Its surface is harsh and largely devoid of water, and its atmosphere is only technically breathable before the fires of human industry poured countless pollutants into the air. The mineral resources beneath its surface, however, were reason enough for the Aurum to claim Metrol and condemn millions to toil in vast, cavernous mines, extracting ore and other valuable materials. In the long-forgotten corners of the city, hives of extraterrestrial creatures ferment and spawn. The depths of Metrol's vast mines are still populated by hordes of enslaved warforged and Cyran refugees (wretchlings). The mines are no longer actively worked by anything more than a skeleton crew. The population centres are capable of producing a significant percentage of their own foodstuffs through fungal farming in long-depleted mineshafts and nutrient reclamation techniques.

As you arrive at a three-storey structure, its exterior plascrete and steel walls discoloured with centuries of grime, Oath-Captain Nils puts on a respirator mask and recommends doing the same, before pushing open the ruststreaked doors.

**Don't forget, the Originator, a sentient prewar designed machination which deploys envoys on schedule. This is necessary for designing suitable hosts for the Inspired.**

***Magical Defenses.*** The vaults are protected against numerous spells and magical effects. Transportive spells such as teleport, gate, and dimension door (and items and features which duplicate their effects) do not function if used to move individual objects within the fortress' walls. These spells function normally if employed within the confines of the fortress. For instance, a creature could teleport itself from the bridge to the intermediate landing, but a creature could not teleport itself from outside of the gate to the intermediate landing or vice versa. The fortress and its grounds are also closed to the Astral and Ethereal planes.

TODO: Devote a portion of the facility for research, so we can lore drop some documents and have a potential battle scene with Charoth ir'Arkenen.

**Complication 1: Getting inside...** 

- Only authorized personnel are able to open the entrances to the vaults and conduct the railway carts.
- Solution: Look for a dead authorized personnel and find a key.

The depositing/withdrawal procedure is of an older system. When a new account is created, the user deposits their belongings into a steel crafted safety deposit box. The user speaks a command word to trigger the *Arcane Lock* and *Magic Mouth*.

Above the right doorframe of the room juxtaposing this hallway hangs a sign, in multiple languages (Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Halfling, Gnomish) the words read "Business Transactions". The glass wall that once safeguarded the operators, secretaries and transaction monitors shines brightly as if enchanted. Behind the glass, a lengthy stone table is covered in a thick velvet red cloth. 

### Section B. Hall of Elders

Making conversation...

- *"You say its 1016 YK, eh? Wow, time really flies when you're stuck underground most of yer days."*
- "Regi" the warforged is monitoring the halls. Seeing the warforged suddenly alert, beginning to charge the party, the dwarf intercepts its path. *"Regi, these are authorized personel depositing into their account, orders from on-high, or at least, so they say. Leave them be. They're with me."* If Regi is asked regarding the date, he will say *"It is his the month of His Rising."*
- He thinks the party to be mad. That or perhaps time hopper. Planewalkers? Chronomancers?

The dwarven spirit (Duaradar) takes the party to a vault. He motions his hand over a stone in the wall, his Mark faintly glowing for a moment. From the stone, a cylindrical section is dislodged from the center. He removes a *chime of opening* and opens the vault. He leaves with the parting words, "Viatrixx will see you now. I hope you brought your papers." His ghost disappears and the *chime* drops to the ground.

### Section B2. Business Department

The spacious chamber beyond is piled high with junk, and the ceiling sags in several places. Nine pools of congealed blood arrayed about the room and the fresh skin-burns and wand discharges scarring the wall speak to the recent violence. The air is thick with the smell of blood and an overpowering scent of decay.

Here, we should see the ghosts of Snorri's deceased parents, their bodies preserved since the Mourning. Alongside the dwarven bookkeepers are gnomish scribes of House Sivis. The dwarf and gnome corpse alike are shackled to metal desks. 

Data Processing: Documents detail shipment plans of warforged to Aundair and Thrane in bulk quantity. Other documents detail account deposits and withdrawals from the city; transaction logs of alleged tax fraud, records of foreign agency credit lines. In front of the mother's body is a note written in blood: "NOT WHAT THEY SEEM." This keycharm goes to her vault deeper in the mines.

- Treasure: **Keycharm**

    *Wondrous Item, common*

    This simple object plays a vital role in the work of House Kundarak. If you possess the Mark of Warding, when you cast *alarm*, *arcane lock*, *glyph of warding*, or similar abjuration effects, you can tie the effect to the keycharm. Whoever holds the keycharm is considered to the owner of this enchantment; they receive the notification from alarm, they can safely avoid a glyph, and they can deactivate any associated effect.

- Journal Entry, Vult 4th, 995 YK, Hurgela d’Doldarun

    "Some time ago, I witnessed something rather peculiar. As I was filling out the traditional paperwork, a cluster of men in dark robes entered the department, flanked by two warforged. I thought nothing of it initially, just confidential customers. However, each day following, the same individuals would re-enter through the front door of the department, each time accompanied by several more people wearing ragged and utterly drenched cloths ... Even more strange, they seemed to never leave the vaults..."

    Most revered and faithful Baron Jorash Mror'anon, May Dodorn's blessing protect you, Confessor. I send for you in most urgent need. We have found something... teribble in the depths beneath the foundations of the vaults. The Chancellor assures us that it is only a setback, but I fear that his confidence is only a show for the younger officers. For all of my fears, I still cannot quite fathom what the thing is. It appears to be some sort of door or gateway, though to where, I cannot say. Something lurks in the mines. This much I know for certain. To leave such a breach in our defenses would be a terrible lapse in protocol, but I fear that Mroranon's pride is getting the better of him. It is for this reason that I write to you. Your blessings may be needed here, most honoured and blessed one. May Dodorn make you strong always, my friend. Colonel Reila Vann

- Treasure: A Letter of Credit (signed by House Sivis scribe) for 2,000 GP. Missing recepient and House Kundarak endorsement (seal). Wax and a signet ring is available admonishing the hammer and anvil. Proficiency with a forgery kit can be used to forge a signature of the Kundarak employee.

Viatrixx (female goblin) is indeed in her office, though her body is long deceased. Her zombified flesh remains and snaps at anyone who gets close. Her legs are bound with chains.

### Section B3. The Vault

Kundarrak security operated via three parties: constructs (warforged, nimblewright), Sivis messaging lines and data processing units, and Kundarrak authorized personale. During the war, House Sivis became untrusted as an entity and Kundarrak opted to automate their roles. Consequently, the entire security system is still functional. The warforged diligently continue to serve their roles, despite the lack of transactions going through the system. Alternatively, the Sivis messaging team was decomissioned (due to deaths) but a Gnome of the House could theoretically operate that part of the system.

A 50ft-by-50ft hallway leads forks into two separate rooms. 

Requires Stealth checks (DC 15) upon entry. 

- Security System Overview

    Getting into the vault requires a series of safety checks, the simultaneous presence of at least two of the following: a customer with an account at the bank, a security guard, or the bank’s manager. First, the parties looking to open the vault must enter the Filing Room and retrieve two valid maglock keycards. Customers with accounts have their keycards stored in lockboxes that line the walls of the filing room, which are unlocked after a valid thumbprint check from the filing room’s Rating 4 thumbprint (Cannith-developed identity) scanner. Guards keep their keycards in similarly locked boxes located in the Staff Room. The manager keeps his card, which will work alongside a customer keycard or a staff keycard to open the vault, on his person.

    *For higher authorization vaults*. Once two valid keycards are simultaneously inserted into the rating 5 Magelocks on both sides of the vault door, the first lock will be disengaged and a magical signal is sent to Sivis security, who will call in (*sending stone*) to the Data Processing Officer’s call station to ensure that the request to open the vault has been authorized. The Data Processing Officer responds with a valid ten digit passcode (sent to the desk terminal *sending stone* at the beginning of the day each day. Access code has a file protection of 2.)

    If Kundarak's call center is satisfied with the answer they get, they will send a wireless signal to the door’s interior lock (Device Rating 4) that disengages it, allowing the vault to be opened. A decker (or Sivis agent) connected to the building’s security host can spoof the magical signal to disengage this lock if they know to look for the lock and what function it serves.

    After 20 minutes the interior lock is programed to re-engage, magnetically forcing the vault shut. Emergency disengagement of this lock can be performed with the simultaneous insertion of two valid keycards into the Rating 3 Maglocks on the inside of the vault door. If these locks are used, a wireless signal will alert the Kundarrak Call center and prompt a call to the Data Processing Officer to assess the situation.

    At night, the bank vault is programmed to instantly sound an alarm if opened, and a Rating 5 sensor array containing motion detectors is activated within the vault.

- *Arcane Eye*. A skilled wizard rigged up a stationary arcane eye with a clairvoyance enchantment and alarm aura - anyone gets into the area of the aura and the wizard gets an alert, immediately able to see through the eye. Charoth ir'Arkenen is currently atuned to this eye. The eye is prone to *blindness* or *dispel magic*. Any damage immediately alerts the enchanter.

The bank’s goods are protected by a state-of-the-art **Kundarrak Secure-Safe Vault - (Health 240, AC 25**). The Vault is extradimensional corresponding to the accessor's identity. To the side of the Vault is an access panel (green glass) and a numeric keypad made of brass. An attempt at a lockpicking triggers the *alarm* causing an immediate discharge of electricity in a 15-foot cone (DEX 15, 6d6 lightning damage) and summoning two security drones* to protect the vault.

Room breakdown:

- Sivis Filing Room

    On the otherside of this archway, an etched stone slab (in Dwarvish) says "Authorized Personale only". 

    This room is locked by means of *Arcane Lock*. Stores magelock keycards. Each keycard includes a thumprint identification and encrypted authorization code. The code can be interchanged through forgery and the thumbprint can be overwritten to use the accessor's identification via *illusory script*. Additionally, records are stored here, appearing encrypted to the untrained eye; these records serve as a database of access codes for authorized users. Often those with higher authorization levels are informed of their codes beforehand (encrypted transfer via the mail system or through asking the front-desk).

    *Treasure:*  Astute characters who succed at reviewing the documents realize with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check a weathered, leather bound book. The tome's matching pair lies on a table in the Sivis Messaging Unit.

    - Transmuter's Tome. Wondrous Item. *A book of seemingly blank pages. To the touch, the bound parchment feels as though covered in dry ink. As an action, the user can inscribe text using a regular quill in plain ink. The written text immediately disappears. As an action, the text can reappear upon the user's demand precisely as was transcribed. Alternatively, the user can send their messages, through means of sending, to another Transmuter's Tome. The text appears immediately and lasts until dismissed as an action.*

    Pro tip: the *Pen of the Scribe* enables the caster to cast *illusory script* at will.

- Staff Agency Room

    This small room has a single desk and chair along with a few cabinets and shelves. It has been thoroughly ransacked and dirt covers everything. Small safety deposit boxes line one side of the room. Immediately above the boxes is an obscured window. A strong stench of rot hangs about the room and a host of flies hover about the bodies of flayed creatures stacked on the floor, pushed against a wall. 

    Behind the bodies, is a small entrance into a ventilation pipe.

    A portion of the wall is etched in scorch marks, its rocky composition crumbled by an effective explosive. The space is just large enough for a small humanoid to squeeze through. The ventilation pipe (steam vent) traverses the wall upward and reaches a curviture to a flat surface 20ft above. 

    *Treasure.* If players can stomach the smell of the room, they are able to find a compartment in the rear of one of the shelves which contains a set of scientific papers on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Astute characters who succeed at reviewing the documents
    realize with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) or Intelligence (Investigation) check that they depict a unique chemical formula which looks to have been transferred to the basilica as a debt payment.

- Sivis Messaging Unit

    Ahead, is an inconsistent light source and the sound of static. When you reach the end of the narrow tunnel, a quiet light greets you, emanating from three of four runic panels centered within this square chamber. The light plays and slides up the columns like pixies flitting through tree branches. As your eyes adjust to the muted light, the deep but vibrant colors of murals painted on the walls catch your attention. Before you can consider it further, whispering and the sound of clanging metal interrupts your investigation.

    These panels have been enchanted, embedded with Siberys shards to act as dragonmark foci for the Sivis dragonmark. A Sivis House representative can touch the panels to send messages. Effectively each rune (gnomish characters) correspond to key numbers of an authorization code. In a hurried action, when a Kundarrak rep inserts their key card, the clerk inscribes the glowing runes, checks the records for the user's access level, and responds with the matching key code through the *message* cantrip. These access codes are rotated on a regular basis and immediately upon use.

    A dragonmarked gnome (undead) appears to still be operating the machinery.

    - Encounter: Clockwork Reliquary (CR 12) - Reduce health to 137

        ![Scenario%203%20The%20Vaults%20of%20Galifar%209b1a034587444ed9859ce7ea503585ab/Untitled%202.png](Scenario%203%20The%20Vaults%20of%20Galifar%209b1a034587444ed9859ce7ea503585ab/Untitled%202.png)

**Puzzle breakdown**

The *keycharm* discovered in the Business Department provides insufficient authorization access. In order for the security to be bypassed, a Sivis representative or other magical user capable of casting *message* must transcribe the glowing runes onto the *Transmuter's Paper*. The recipient of the access code then checks their files for the individual's access information (a table entry including the user's name, access key-value pair). This access code is sent by *message* to the accessor, who enters the code via the numeric keypad.

Inside the vault: There are 110 **safe deposit boxes** (**Health 62, AC 20**) within the vault. 

Each is secured by a Rating 3 maglock keypad. Traps are engaged throughout the vault.

2150 XP + 1480 XP = 3630 XP

### Section C. The Infested Tombs

(1) *The Proving Altars:* The corrupt Reforged Cultists must still replenish their numbers as they succumb to age. Every day dozens die gruesomely on the proving altars, where hopefuls go to implant themselves with the organs of devotion. Each of the eight altars consists of a stone operating plinth and a black case that holds organs, medical sacraments, and ritual instruments. Even under the potent stimulants, immune-suppressors, and pain blockers in the sacraments, very few have the skill and the fortitude to survive such a self-performed operation. Although the particulars of the ritual implants vary from one forge district to another. In most locations, the case contains cooling units to keep the organic components from spoiling too quickly. Some of the most commonly found organs include:

- Mutagens (roll 1d20, injectable, effects are permanent - think Bioshock additives):

    [Mutagens](Scenario%203%20The%20Vaults%20of%20Galifar%209b1a034587444ed9859ce7ea503585ab/Mutagens%2061c595835c5f46b1ae7a8e75a0c2c027.csv)

    - **Precision** Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. ***Side effect.*** You have disadvantage on Strength saving throws.
    - **Rapidity** Your speed increases by 10 feet. ***Side effect.*** You have disadvantage on Intelligence ability checks.
    - **Reconstruction** For 1 hour, at the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to your proficiency bonus if you have at least 1 hit point, but no more than half of your hit points. ***Side effect.*** Your speed decreases by 10 ft for 1 hour.
    - **Sagacity** Your Intelligence score increases by 3, as does your Intelligence maximum. ***Side effect.*** You have disadvantage on Charisma saving throws.
    - **Shielded** You gain resistance to slashing damage. ***Side effect.*** You gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
    - **Unbreakable** You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage. ***Side effect.*** You gain vulnerability to piercing damage.
    - **Vermillion** You gain an additional use of your Blood Maledict feature. ***Side effect.*** You have disadvantage on death saving throws.
- Organic Augmentations ("Organs of Devotion")

    • *Esratz Eye* – Every survivor has a slightly different tale of what this augmetic eye reveals when they connect it to their optic nerve, but more than one candidate has expired from terror after completing this step.
    • *Arcane Propulsion Arm* – This implant is meticulously replaced to ensure it does not decay too far. It is always cut from a living person and then allowed to age eight days before being placed in the case.
    • *Docent* – The composition of this palmsized organ varies widely. Most commonly, it is a small circuit board or cogitator matrix, but more esoteric interpretations also exist. While it grants no known functionality, making space for it in one’s chest cavity is an exercise in special calculations. A docent is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards.
    • *Ventilating Lungs* – Used only by the most elite forge districts, whose preserved ranks of the Reforged age slowly and can wait decades for a promising candidate to replenish them. This artificial lung is an airtight weave of metal and glass. It is one of the most diabolical self-implantation rites because the aspirant must first remove an organ lung to exchange for the filament lung.

- **Encounter: Fellforged (CR 5), 8 Ghoul, Beggar (CR 1/2)**

(2) *Sepulchre Sigma*. The sepulchre once served as the hallowed grounds of Dwarven war heroes of the Last War. Since the war, the sepulchre has served as a torture chamber operated by the Ghorad’din (Snorri would be familiar). 

Bas-reliefs of battle climb the steep walls of the morgue, and statues of saints and war heroes crowd its many winding paths. It is a still, dead place with mist coiling between the magnificent tombs. The lids are carved in the likenesses of grim dwarves in armor. Dwarvish runes on the front of each tomb appear to represent the names of the occupants or the intended occupants. Not until you set foot on the stone floor do you smell the overtone of blood and hear the wails echoing faintly between every rock. The sound has no source; it is constant as wind or tide—seeming to rise from the stone itself like the ghostly voices of the buried dead. The smooth, white floor and walls—decorated with reaper carvings and reliefs of pitiless Saints—show smears of old blood. 

**NPC:** Blaise Maddred. A prisoner, Prisoner 1374-12 lies in a coffin filled with swarming rats. His arms and legs are bound by *Dimensional Shackles*. He refuses to go with the party if set free, choosing his own path out of the tomb system. "I'm not going back in there... The moment they see me, I'll be dead." He languishes in one of the Sepulchre’s many marble tombs. The emaciated prisoner’s many wounds are cleanly bandaged and he constantly twitches from the nerve damage of repeated interrogations. His brother run a clinic in the slums, though only the privileged can access his services. He knows the warforged religion and their development of the "Becoming God". He speaks calmly, with gratitude and interest. He points to a steel grating hatch that leads below. "You want in discretely? The Red Line. That's your best bet. You know why they call it that? Because that's where all the blood goes."

### Section C.2 The Red Line (optional sewage entry)

The air is so thick with promethium that it appears to ripple before your eyes. Constant dripping sounds come from everywhere, mingled with the erratic heartbeat of struggling hydraulic pumps. A small stream of mixed, shimmering liquid runs through the bottom of the pipe beneath your feet.

The sewage liquid byproduct as high as their feet is not water, but coagulated blood and plasmid. 

As you continue deeper into the pipelines and refining vats, you begin to notice more than just the hazards of poor maintenance. Between the sounds of unhealthy machinery is the faint echo of repetitive impacts, like a giant hammer being swung. Large chunks of rock appear in the tunnel, and then the cracked and mangled cones of wrecked bits from some huge drill. Stranger still are the bizarre artefacts strewn amidst the rock. Most of them are made of a gleaming obsidian material. They combine clean planes and sharp angles with irregular pitted masses. Each one suggests an object without being shaped like that object, and their suggestions change under the distortions of the fumes in the air.

- Trap: Tripwire (PCP 15)

    If the party triggers one of the caps, the chemical suspension in the pipes flares up, turning the Red Line into an inferno. Those caught in the explosion take 3d10 fire damage. Those closest to the trigger take an additional 2d10 blundgeoning damage from falling pigments of stone. Finally, the individual who triggers the trap takes an additional 6d10 blundgeoning (DEX save, halved) and are restrained by the dislodged pipe. The party could optionally be forcibly separated, adding an additional hour of time (group SRV check, DC 15) to find their ways back together through the maze-like pipelines of the sewage system. The trap alerts 2 warforged guards.

### Section D. Rail System

This massive chamber is filled with the deafening hum and roar of machinery. Piles of rough rock ore are spread throughout the area, around which a prisoner work gang toils in the sweltering heat. Smooth metallic columns rise to the ceiling, with open hatches set into their sides at ground level. Haggard prisoners frantically shovel ore into these hatches, which pulse with a deep-red glow.

- **Encounter: 2 Oaken Bolter (CR 5)**

    This elaborate, well-decorated weapon of war appears harmless without a
    crew . . . until it shifts to aim in your direction and begins loading itself.

Earth Elements pass regularly through the rail systems.

*(1) Entrance.* A flight of rickety metal stairs leads to a catwalk that runs the perimeter of the middle floor, missing grating in several places. A single fogged window has been boarded up. Several vents and pipes open to the lower floors. The rear door exits onto a gantry walkway scored by recent wand discharges and bullet impacts. The heavy folding door of the loading ramp opens to a sheer drop below.

*(2) The Rail System.* The rail system seem barely functional, and the surrounding areas are rife with failing machinery, inoperable lumen fixtures, and collapsing gantries and corridors. A noxious smoke billows up from below, suffusing the area and reducing visibility. Liquid ceaselessly drips down from the ceiling, a filthy liquid combining effluent, toxic by-products, and simple grime. The constant drainage coats the area in a greasy, foul-smelling slime. Though there is no immediate danger from this liquid, an observer cannot help but wonder if the miasma contributes to the universally sickly nature of the specimen present.

### Section D II. Black Engine Terminus

The spiked iron beast that presently travels the rails is the invention of East Cannith's current regime, its utility relies on the inimitable phenomenon surrounding the ethereal-tech track. The track does not exist solely in the physical world. Anything that touches it takes on the same properties, becoming Incorporeal. This allows vehicles upon it to travel without the restraint of physics or air friction, and to ignore any environmental hazards.

Your ears are assaulted by the shrill howl of screeching metal generated by the oscillating blades around the wheels. This is accompanied by a sudden drop in the stifling temperature of vault's air. The Engine of the machine stretches out from its origin ten meters long with a face carved into a perpetually open maw. Razor sharp metal implements jut forward, forming the impression of teeth and a leering tongue. The construct’s body bulges in a segmented arch, with each metal plate possessing a spindle of more blades that slice and spin at anything close to its body. Groaning chains link a baroque ebony carriage to the Engine; the two are roughly equal in size.

Alternative: During the train's arrival, onlookers can see cloaked figures unloading large glass cylinders filled with unrecognizable liquids (these containers hold the bioluminiscent fungi, preserved and transported from the Genesys Station).

**NPC:** The engineer (see Murder on the Eberron Express)

- The train leads to the following locations.

    (1) The Genesys Station

    (2) Karrnath Bay Foraging Station

    (3) Gas chambers / Exilation

    - On its path to this location, the rail becomes momentarily temporal, solified in the Material plane.
    - Encounter: 13 Undead Constructs (ref. CoC)

    (4) Riedra

    (5) Major nations? Consider fast-travel to Aundair.

### Section E. The Irradial Forge Slums

As you proceed, the colossal forge grows on the horizon like a rising, malignant sun. Its outline ripples, and you cannot tell if it the effect of the forge's constant heat, or some shifting property of the structure. It is as large as any hive, a twisting complex of pipes and chimneys and panels. Some portions are meticulously ordered while others look more like the result of an accident than a design. Eventually a secondary structure emerges in the distance, hundreds of feet away from the forge itself: the two spiky pillars of the shipyard. Not until you are nearly at the end of the rail do the ramshackle slums come into view. They are a sad, sprawling clutter of metal boxes. In the shadow of the forge, the flimsy, stunted buildings look more like the forge’s rejected offal than the homes of millions. The closer you draw, the more oppressive the heat becomes. 

Here in these slums, the enslaved human menials eke out a meagre existence during the precious few hours they do not labour for the Forge. The Order of the Vinculum Proselytes place an emphasis on breeding volume, so the majority of the Irradial Forge’s menials are born, live, and die within the tainted space. However, a steady infusion of slaves keeps the gene pool varied and viable.

A life of privation and toil quickly grinds down the spirit no matter where the slave was born. The menials are as a rule too downtrodden and effectively conditioned to do more than what their masters demand and scratch in the dirt to survive. They wear loose mass-produced coveralls. Those that have hair keep their hair closely cropped though many of these humanoid are completely shaven. The miasma of gases in the atmosphere traps radiant heat. Like an insect under a magnifier, wood, parchment, clothing, and other flammable materials are subject to combustion when the temperature is at its peak. Large pails of inert mineral powder fill every corner of the slums.

Your eyes are drawn immediately to the blocky, bipedal war machine between the two docking towers. The battered Titan has been posed in a gesture of defeat and servitude; it kneels with its gun barrel arms stretched between the spires. Even on its knees the god-machine is nearly a hundred feet tall. Central to the gargantuan facility, looming overhead, suspended by enormous spiked chains is a construct of immeasurable size. Three large tanks dominate the base of the structure. The tanks are over seven metres in diameter and five metres high. A number of sigils are stencilled on to the structures warning of their explosive nature. They are also covered in camouflage netting.

A single man is present outside a rather gritty apartment building. A small fume tapers from a lit cigarrette. He wavers slowly back-and-forth, almost drifting into unconsciousness, until he sees you. He gives you a serious stare for a moment before reaching into his back pocket pulling out a pistol. He cocks the gun, placing the weapon against his head and pulls the trigger. His body drops.

This human caretaker has actively monitored the health of what he deems "hopeless causes." A natural-born sickness plagues the deteriorating states of the inhabitants, living a squalid lifestyle.

Alerted by the death of the individual, this construct originates from around the corner of the building.

- **Encounter: Cadaver Collector (CR 14)**

    The ancient war machines known as cadaver collectors lumber aimlessly across the blasted plains of Acheron until they are called upon by a necromancer, hobgoblin general, or other evil warlord to bolster the ranks of a conquering army. These fearsome constructs obey their summoners until being dismissed back to Acheron, but if a summoner comes to a bad end, a cadaver collector might wander the Material Plane for centuries, collecting corpses while searching for a way to return home.

    ***Sweeping the Dead.*** Cadaver collectors respond to a summons from a mortal only when they are called to the scene of a great battle — either where one is in progress, where one is imminent, or where one once took place. They encase themselves in the armor and weapons of fallen warriors and impale the corpses of those warriors on the lances and other weapons embedded in their salvaged armor.

***The Dispensary***
The charred skeletons of a few more stubborn individuals are permanently fused to the building. 

Men bludgeoning one another with rocks and pipes to be first in line; people shove and jostle, and a desparate woman falls to the ground is crushed under the press of bodies. 

Blaise speaks out, "Every few days someone tries to scale the outside of the dispensary to reach the higher floors where the rations are stored. To prevent such escapades, the dispensary’s outer walls are coated with heat-intensifying foil. A would-be liberator is lucky to fall back to the ground with major burns. Yet always, someone else is hungry enough to think they can succeed where the last man failed."

DM Notes: With no flora and no organic fauna to speak of, the menials are utterly reliant on the Irradial Forge to feed them. A hungry worker is a less productive worker, and the Forge’s Magi run exact calculations to ensure the optimal mass of protein ships to the dispensary each day. Inevitably, these rations fall short. Not by intent, but through theft, spoilage, and neglect. Twice a day, crowds form and conflict ignites as the dispensary hands out corpse starch wafers. This is an opportunity to see the menials at their worst. Some days, members of the mutant elite come to watch the sport. If the show fails to be bloody enough for them, they remove some of the food to up the crowd’s desperation.

### Section G. The Bridge

***Security Gauntlet***

This unlit hallway is wide but otherwise featureless.

The PCs don’t know of the danger here unless they succeed on the required skill checks. Stepping into a numbered area activates a pressure plate linked to all the associated traps (see above). A net launches from a hatch in the ceiling, the ceiling scythes start swinging, and a secret door rises into the ceiling, releasing a whirling blade automaton. The arcane turret activates when either set of traps is activated.

- Skill Checks
    - History Check DC 20: Cannith facilities—especially those surrounding creation forges—often have security trap gauntlets in halls such as this one.
    - Perception Check DC 17: Thin, shallow cuts mark the floor in several places. (These cuts are due to the ceiling scythes.) DC 19: There are slots in the ceiling above the cuts in the floor. (A character who makes a DC 15 Dungeoneering check recognizes these as signs of the ceiling scythes trap.) DC 20: The dust and debris indicate that no traffic of any sort has moved down this hallway in a long time. DC 21: Some of the marble flagstones are slightly raised; they must be pressure plates for a trap. When an automaton activates, read: A construct like a whirling top spins out of a compartment in the wall. Sharp blades spin at its highest point.
- Trap: 2 Ceiling Scythes

***Bladeworks - Weapons Manufacturing***

Double stone doors lead into a barrel-vaulted area containing several furnaces. The eastern end of the chamber continues into a large, dark cave, from which a cold wind moans. A stream of water rushes from west to east through the center of the room, crossed by two stone bridges. 

The shimmering air and heated atmosphere of a fully-functional forge assaults the senses. Two warforged operate the furnaces, hammering gleaming steel into construct-like appendages, one of them waving a hand over a glowing sigil at the nearby furnace.

Encounter: 

- 3 Clockwork Huntman (*ToB,* CR 3)
- 2 Clockwork Myrmidion (*ToB,* CR 6)

This forge was created for the necessary crafting of metal objects, including armor, weapons, and construct parts. A fire elemental entrapped in the furnace of the forge provides supernatural heat to their metalworking. 

***Command Control - Overlook's Point***

RECAP ~ 

Last time in Eberron, you ventured deeper down into the Vaults of Cyre. There you faced almost cannibalistic humans, wretched beings doomed to toil in steamy heat and agonizing labor, suffering under the iron hand of the warforged building what they believed to be their Coming Messiah, their Becoming God. You battled against these forged, yourself also under the illusory facade of warforged, and found one of their overseers, Lord Charoth ir'Arkenen. Working together, you chased and slayed the man, finding in fact, that he himself was also warforged. As the wounded Arkenen dropped, so also did his illusions. And you find yourself now encased in a prism of glass, knowingly only by means of subtle teleportation or a physical alteration of reality. Outside the prism, you see a labor force of human scientists. Their feet are shackled, metal chains hooking them up to the appliances. Looking slightly concerned by your presence, they continue their efforts feverishly, turning dials, mixing chemicals and monitoring arcanic glass panels.

### Section H. The Crucible Forge (the "Originator")

***Sector C Test Labs***

This wing is devoted to research regarding postwar warforged design. Lab equipment is available (*alchemist supplies*, *tinker's tools*). 

Two warforged guards equipped with intricate firearms defend the two exits branching from this central laboratory. A gold chestplate and greaves mark one of the warforged guards as the ranking officer (Sentinel). A woman (Adassa Sano) stands attentively monitoring the players, especially magic users. She casts counterspell at any indication of spellcasting. She is eventually interrupted by her daughter (who lives with her), carrying a metallic doll with a lacquered grimace across its face. Shackled scientists hurry their work, cautiously avoiding the gazes of their overseers.

- Perhaps a ghostly apparition OR adjacent to a ritual chamber, a reservoir of spiritual energy concealed within. A metal coffin is suspended on chains over a raised platform. Within the chamber rests the vampiric spawn Jurian ir'Wynarn, his memory wiped by the subservient charm placed on him. If his memories are restored (via *greater restoration*) he recalls being taken by surprise during the party's layover in Korth.

- A helpful illustratation on the wall precautions the reader with the following information regarding hazards within the research complex.
    - Electrical hazards, from electrical apparatus and power systems;
    - Burning / heat hazards, from steam pipes, furnaces or any other hot apparatus;
    - Freezing hazards, from freezers and super coolants;
    - Acid / corrosive hazards, from countless acid and alkali chemicals in all different applications;
    - Radioactive hazards, from nuclear reactors and waste;
    - Biohazards, from biological waste and residue;
    - A risk of drowning in extremely deep water basins
    - Being harmed / killed by underwater machinery
    - A risk of fractures from falling, and / or machinery

### Shattered Dreamgate

Looming overhead, massive archway of violet crystal fills the cavern with a faded violet light. Green mold grows in its many pits and cracks. 

**Effect:** The area for 300 feet around a shattered dreamwar gate carries a feeling of altered reality. The landscape appears dreamlike from its long association with the Region of Dreams (though the area undergoes no physical change). Creatures that do not dream (such as elves, kalashtar, and warforged) and creatures immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities see nothing unusual. 

**Activation:** To access the power of a shattered dreamwar gate, a character must move through the arch. A character doing so takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and disappears for 3 rounds, during which time he appears to those on the outside as a ghostly image that has been plunged into a terrifying nightmare. 

**Recharge:** Once a shattered dreamwar gate has conferred a bonus to a character, it cannot affect another creature for one year.

**Special Ability (Ps):** A character who passes through a shattered dreamwar gate can thereafter blur the line between dreams and reality. Once per day, he can
manifest *false sensory input (minor illusion)* as a psi-like ability.

The "Originator'

What if the vault is present with tons of warforged operating a laboratory like situation? Underground transportation system (think Ravnica) leads to the Underwater harvesting plant. Malfunctioning warforged storage and creation (think Detroit Become Human and Westworld).
