# Scenario 4: Genesys Station

Music:

Bioshock-themed dungeon, doubling as a sort of holy sanctuary for the Deep Ones.

Multiple entrances: 
- Cave entrances (South-eastern Lake Cyre)
- Underwater entrance
- Via ethereal rail

*(1) Entrance.* A flight of rickety metal stairs leads to a catwalk that runs the perimeter of the middle floor, missing grating in several places. A single fogged window has been boarded up. Several vents and pipes open to the lower floors. The rear door exits onto a gantry walkway scored by recent wand discharges and bullet impacts. The heavy folding door of the loading ramp opens to a sheer drop below.

(2) 

The facilities seem barely functional, and the surrounding areas are rife with failing machinery, inoperable lumen fixtures, and collapsing gantries and corridors. A noxious fog rises up from below, suffusing the area and reducing visibility. Liquid ceaselessly drips down from the ceiling, a filthy liquid combining effluent, toxic by-products, and simple grime. The constant drainage coats the area in a greasy, foul-smelling slime. Though there is no immediate danger from this liquid, an observer cannot help but wonder if the miasma contributes to the universally sickly nature of the specimen present.

***Egg Chamber***

Every surface of the egg-shaped chamber is coated in that organic secretion, and hundreds of glistening, green egglike structures are mounted within it. These range in size from just 6 inches (15 cm) long to being almost as tall as a human.

An exit leads out of the chamber to the south, but that opening is mostly covered by the spongy matter and thus not immediately obvious (nor is it shown on the map). 

The Eggs: Despite their appearance, the green structures aren’t eggs. A better analogy might be seed pods or fungal fruiting bodies. Close examination of the base of each pod reveals the twisted remains of human corpses that have been cultivated for their biomass. In other words, the pods have grown out of the corpses, and most of the flesh and bones have been liquefied, incorporated into the base of the pod, and hardened into the new shape. The pods hold one stage of the development of the nagaina, although this stage has two bodies, not one.

***The Enlightened Ones***

This area is a maze of damaged controls and broken machinery. Countless wires twist their way across the walls, erupting from control panels that have been pulled apart to lay bare their internal components. Five clear canisters connected by metal tubing and wires line the walls, each one filled with viscous fluid— and what appears to be a humanoid brain.

***The Central Atrium***

The central atrium of the facility appears encapsulated by glass walls containing a vast amount of water, spanning the height from floor to ceiling, the water's surface level remaining out of site. The illuminated coral floor ahead falls away in a marked declivity, and bears curiously regular blocks of stone in certain places, disposed as if in accordance with definite patterns. You see an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices; magnificent though unclassified architecture in various stages of preservation. Most appear to be of marble, gleaming whitely in the rays of light given off by softly illuminating everbright lanterns. Numerous isolated temples and villas appear on the steep slopes toward the far side.

You examine the scene more closely, and behold the remains of stone and marble bridges and sea-walls, and terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful. At the end of the city, facing a cliff wall, you are confronted by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building, evidently a temple, hollowed from the solid rock. Of the original workmanship of this titanic object you can only make conjectures. The facade, of immense magnitude, apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its windows are many and widely distributed. In the center yawns a great open door, reached by an impressive flight of steps, and surrounded by exquisite carvings in relief. Foremost of all are the great columns and frieze, both decorated with sculptures of inexpressible beauty; obviously portraying idealized pastoral scenes and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial devices in adoration of a radiant god. The art is of the most phenomenal perfection, and imparts an impression of terrible antiquity, as though it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of elven art. You cannot doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of the cliff wall. It is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated you cannot imagine. Perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the nucleus. Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this temple—for temple indeed it must be— it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of the chasm.

**Factorum Mortuarius** *(see Dark Heresy, Gamemaster's Kit)*

(1) *Factorum Mortuarius -* a mortician / dead preparation centrum; could provide undead resources for Vol's army (a portion of which initially collected by the *Corpse Collectors* and stored in Atur's "cold storage"); the Mourning, thus, created an indefinite number of salvageable corpses for this purpose. The Emerald Claw serves as a puppet for the Inspired's ultimate plan for conquest.

Additionally, this factory is operated by warforged; thus those entering / exiting the mists of the Mourning are constructs and undead; the mists offer cover for the operation.
