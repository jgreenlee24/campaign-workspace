**Personell Casualties:** Fridras Hosqusco, Bren Venkram, Chay Tei, Warforged (Needle, Carrier, Judge, Junior)

### **Setup**

**Employed by Lhara Finewind d'Lyrandar and Lady Valeriya ir'Rurik to examine the situation and establish an outpost in Metrol. As a result, a recruited platoon of "Cyran avengers" *and* Royal Eyes operatives will be on this mission.**

**House Sivis and House Orien have also been looking into affording this same effort.**

***Pre-flight:*** Your company has formed up into several long lines, which lead up to the boarding ramps. A Commissar and an Officer both wait at the entrance, checking off names and serial numbers as soldiers enter the craft. Once through the doors, you quickly understand the reason for the lines—gear must be carefully stowed above and below each jump seat. The seats require assembling a web of buckles and belts to safely fit each fully equipped soldier into a space that seems far too small.

A mixture of steel and soarwood, the deck of this armored airship reflect the faint glow of a brilliant elemental ring that is bound to the vessel. You are aboard the Shadowhawk. Off the starboard bow, even mired in darkness, the noxious purple iridescence of the glowing chasm writhes above a gaping canyon. So when you look over the edge between the strange forms of aerial, nocturnal creatures and the battered rooftops that make up the once proud capital city of Metrol, you can feel the hollow tunnels of wind whipping past you sending a frigid shiver through your spine. A murky cloud covers the night, electricity ripples throughout the clouds, a large shadowed figure swoops over obscuring it from vision for a couple of seconds before the mist dissipates.

The Shadowhawk (called a "dropship") has two decks. The upper deck is generally assigned to transport up to a full company of soldiers, while the lower deck accommodates all of the support vehicles necessary for their deployment. This combination allows soldiers to have easy access to the full range of their gear in the event that the craft must land under hostile conditions— such as on this assignment.

**Scenario Option 1: The Drop**

*"Here are packs, everybody grab one. You'll find in the pack a stone with a feather on it. The stone slows your fall, however it only is effective in a specific time frame. There is a lightning rail station, it is probably long dormant, however there may be some Khyber conductor stone crystals still there, not to mention elementals likely wandering about; if you can bind an elemental, you have power." - Krulek*

Provided equipment through artificer contact:

- *potion of water breathing*, *cloak of the manta ray*, *cap of water breathing*
- poison/acid: *necklace of adaptation*, *ventilating lungs*

Binding an Elemental (*Magic of Eberron*, 11):

- Binding an elemental requires a single *Khyber Dragonshard* (~500gp) equivalent to the elemental's CR * 100 Galifars. The binding can be performed by those with a *Lyrandar Dragonmark* or a wizard/druid Arcana check (DC 20) - gnomes have advantage on this check.
    - Generally, elemental binding is a three-person task (summoner, sealer, binder)
    - Requires *magic circle* (3rd level abjuration) *planar binding* (5th level abjuration spell)
    - Alternatives: *ring of elemental command*, *brazier of commanding <type> elemental*
    - The propulsive power of *conductor stones* is simply magnetism. The stones themselves are of *residuum*, a glass-like substance crafted out of refined whitestone, not inherently magic, but particularly receptive to arcane energies and enchantments. When brought close together, the stones create a powerful repulsive force.

As you begin to plummet, you see the cloud layers racing towards you, lightning rippling through it. You feel the cold around you displaced by a furnace feeling as the heat begins to rise. You wisp through the first layer of clouds. A manta-like creature glides above the degraded architecture, its shadowy silhouette conveying a figure with barbs along the edges of its wingspan and long eye stalks. Its size larger than that of the airship from which you embarked... you are falling center mass.

**Encounter:** 3 Enlarged *Cloaker* (CR 8)

(PCP 15) Manta-ray like creature, with barbs along the edges of its wingspan and long eye stalks, its size larger than the airship. You are falling center mass. (DX 15) - You clear the barbs on the edge of the wing. You feel the oily skinned wing rise back up, and a moment later goes back down and you start to rocket toward the edge of the wing.

The wall of roiling mist rises ahead of you, appearing solid and ephemeral at the same time. Passing into the cloying mist is like entering an alien plane of existence. Light barely reflects through the shifting layers of vapor. Sound becomes muffled and distant, even when produced nearby. The place has a narrow, ominous feel to it, and a feeling of isolation and growing dread builds within you as you cascade deeper into the pits of an area unknown.

**Scenario Option 2: Sabotage**

Ship Outline: 

- Crew compartment, Passenger Section, Cargo Bay, Lightning Elemental Chamber (Engine Room), Cockpit (Helm), Upper (sterncastle and forecastle) and lower decks ("drop" deck, support vehicles for deployment)

The engines emit a deafeningly loud roar that reverberates through the crew compartment. It continues for at least fifteen minutes, and then is abruptly disrupted by a loud explosion, which shakes the vessel. After that, the sound of the engines and the air circulation systems completely cease. The cabin lights switch to a grim red light that splashes bloody shadows across everyone’s face.

The engines have been silent for what seems like an eternity. The temperature of the passenger compartment has risen to the point that everyone is sweating, and the stench of unwashed humanity has become potent. The arrhythmic swaying of the airship has induced nausea in many of the members of your company, and the stench has only made the situation even more insufferable. Just as the situation seems to become even more deplorable, the hatch separating the crew compartment from the passenger section of the vessel unlocks and slams open. A wave of heat and the stench of burnt flesh assault your senses. By happenstance, your group was placed closest to the opening.

**The Cockpit**

In the cockpit, the characters discover a scene of recent disaster. All four crew members are dead (2 copilots (Kirin Bor and Mirra Touli), Corporal Sigret Ashlen, and second officer Rhysimor Maceck), slain by what appears to have been a stray blast of energy that struck the lightly armored windshield. Many of the ship’s control systems were also damaged in the assault. - 4 *feather tokens*, *Wand of Binding*, signet rings (Orien, Lyrandar)

**When they enter the cockpit**, a calm, synthesized voice immediately addresses them, asking for their assistance and directing their actions. It is looping a question towards them, which is barely audible over the sounds of the rushing wind. That question is, “Engines are not responding. Begin emergency antigravity descent?”

The area is filled with massive cogitators, complex machinery, and other devices with scant spare room for crew to maneuver. Keeping in mind that every seat is currently occupied by a badly scorched dead body, the characters have very little space. This complicates their efforts to reach the controls. At the moment, there are dozens of warning glyphs flashing from the cockpit’s view screens. The vast majority of the glyphs describe damage to the airship's armor and critical systems, including the engines.

**The Crew's Quarters**

*The crew's quarters were designed for a much larger crew, which makes them feel too big and empty for the current crew. The cabins are small and contain a simple cot, a table with one chair, and a locker for personal items.*

- **Sergeant Corbin Hayworth** lies unconscious in his quarters, dealt a severe concussive blow to his skull. (Medicine Check or Investigation check reveals that the wound appears done by a bludgeoning weapon, a nearby support beam also appears bloodied, implying the Sergeant injured himself likely by accident).
- **Nob Guzzmasha**, (goblin) the ship's artificer and mechanic has been injected with a paralytic poison (Blue Whinnis); he too lies consciously suffering in his quarters.

You hear and feel a cataclysmic bang that seems to stretch on for hours. The floor shakes like a crashing lander, as walls buckle and ceiling tiles avalanche from above. A rent in the floor opens, and you smell the faint odor of Cyre’s noxious atmosphere wafting into the room. The lights flicker, and conduits and cables that should be hidden by bulkheads are suddenly visible. Sparks and fluids shower everywhere. When the floor finally stops shaking—or at least seems to slow—it seems uneven, as though the entire level is tilted to the side. Emergency lights have kicked on, granting a surreal contrast of light and shadow as cables and pipes begin to sway in what had been a secure environment until moments earlier.
