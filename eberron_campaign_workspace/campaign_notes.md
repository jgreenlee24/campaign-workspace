# Eberron: Campaign Notes

Narrative Mechanics vs. Proper Story Structure

What is salvageable of the current story?

Cagyn Rilid, scientist of farmed bioluminescent blue substance with regenerative powers in vent faults at bottom of Kraken Bay.

“The Orphanage” lab locations:

1. near Tanar Rath (in scion sound)

2. near Lake Cyre (south of Metrol)

3. Kraken Bay (near border between Mournland & Valenar)

Consider Narrative mechanics: Setbacks, Overcoming Flaws, etc.

Aspects of a Character: Quirks, Ideal (Moral Outlook), Motivation, Flaw

^ Might be useful for choosing narratives to identify these four aspects for each character.

What kind of story do we want to tell?

For K’atai, perhaps its a story of owning one’s identity and bravely standing against the oppressive tyranny of Khalashtar in Sarlona. K’atai has a connection in Fairhaven with the Path of the Wandering Light, a temple devoted to the Path of Light. Could this Khalasthar community be the cause of Fairhaven’s takeover?

For Corrine, it’s a coming of age story where she learns to usurp the throne that had been taken away from her. This has several consideration such as proving her identity and not being backstabbed by allegiances to the current throne (that’s an interesting mechanic, if a familiar face offers to help, only to backstab them for their own personal gain).

Count the Successes:

- Destruction of the Warforged Titan (acquiring a Khyber dragonshard)
- Finding and repairing the airship Last Horizon.
- 

In-flight:

- Silver Flame
    - Thrane war efforts (vs. Breland)
    - Karrnath war efforts (vs. Thrane)
    - 
    - 
- Aundair
    - Consider: what is Aundair’s response to these efforts?
        - The “recent” death of Aundair’s ambassadors in Zilargo.
        - The death of the Brelish ambassador in Karrnath.
    - Change in Leadership: Death of Queen Aurala (assassination)
- Illithid and the Dreaming Dark
    - Exorciated Illithid nautiloid effectively parked beneath the Arts District of Metrol.
    - Experimentation (ceramorphosis) on Khalashtaar, Githyanki and gifted / talented students. What’s the relation between these? (a) Psionic vulnerability.

Story Progressions:

Key Previous Events:

- Kidnapping of the Keeper (allegedly by Breland’s Dark Lanterns)
    - What councils were held following this event?
        - The declaration of war likely followed a failure of consensus in a council meeting between Breland and Thrane.
- The “Disruption” - Drowning of Atur; the Rise of Dagon
    - Effectively a critical location sabotage by [[ organization ]].
- Employment to Investigate Metrol
    - Mission to ...
    - Represented
- Consider the benefit of secret societies: conspiracy theories, hoax, proliferation of reactionary ideologies, prophecies, historical monastic orders, secret bloodlines, etc.

Key Major Organizations:

- The “Orphanage” (Shadow Council)
    - Effectively an ideological research institution.
    - Consider key representatives from Dragonmarked houses (Vadalis, Jorasco, Cannith) and military investors (Deneith, possibly Aundair?). Prominent leaders of each Dragonmarked house kept the operation secretive with respect to public knowledge within the house.
        - Aundair’s always had a shitty army, they hire out mercenaries without discretion and in times of need mandate civilian participation. Their investment would make sense.. but perhaps Aurala’s withdrawal caused her assassination (news of her death was made known to the party
    - This would be a tightly ran operation with multiple locations.
- Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) - an occult initiatory organization founded … claimed exclusive descent from the original organization and primacy over the other conferences and branches of the SF Religion.
    - Governing Bodies: The Grand Tribunal, Chapters of Rose Croix, etc.
        - Camps -> Chapters -> Sanctuaries
    - Initiations: Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, Master Mason
    - Rituals: Mass
    - Documents: Holy Royal Arch of Enoch
    - Leaders: Sovereign Hymenaeus Beta X
    - Philosophy / Objective:
- Priory of Scion
