# Rumored Creation Forge a Hoax

*Aryth 22nd, 998*

SHARN—Morgrave University Professor Casterran Juliax apologized to fellow scholars and the district of Cogsgate for the chaos that ensued on Far when he led a fact-finding expedition to reveal a working creation forge for warforged—a forge that didn’t exist.

Accompanied by several researchers, a detachment of city Watch, and several dozen curious district residents, Juliax entered an abandoned vault along Chimney Street. A reporter from the Sharn Inquisitive was among those in attendance.

Shortly after entering the building, the clash of arms rang out. When initial reports from the Watch indicated the presence of warforged in the vault, hope spread like wildfire among the researchers that an intact creation forge had been found. Rumors resounded throughout the district, and a crowd of several hundred gathered, blocking traffic along Chimney Street and the Galluron Bridge.

But a shamefaced Juliax appeared at the doors of the vault about a half-hour later and told the crowd that the vault was empty and the warforged inside were merely squatters. Several warforged were placed under arrest, wanted by the Watch for a variety of petty crimes. The city Watch intervened after an angry confrontation between Juliax and several members of his team, then dispersed the crowd.

Rumors of a creation forge somewhere in the lower districts of Sharn have emerged periodically for years, taking on greater urgency since the end of the Last War.

Merrix d’Cannith, a prominent leader within House Cannith, pointed out that the creation forges were all shut down permanently as part of the Treaty of Thronehold. Cannith remains a strong supporter of the treaty and has shifted its research to other areas, he said.
