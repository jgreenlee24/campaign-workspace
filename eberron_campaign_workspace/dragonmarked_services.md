# Eberron: Dragonmarked Services

**House Sivis**

House Sivis is composed of twelve families, including the Torralyns, Severins, Lyrrimans, Syrralans, Corralyns and Santors. The stability of the house takes presedence over personal ambition. Lysse Lyrriman d’Sivis of Korranberg is the current matriarch (as she has been for the last 90 years).

### House Vadalis

Drafthorse (50gp, 40ft), Riding Horse (75gp, 60ft), Warhorse (400gp, 60ft)

Magebred Basilisks (~300 GP, trained adult 2,500 gp): Perfect for defending your vault or private prison! All magebred Basilisks are trained to respond to a specific password to allow you and your staff to pass safely, but uninvited visitors are sure to get a nasty surprise! (Breeder's note: be sure not to deploy basilisks in areas with still bodies of water or large reflective surfaces)

Magebred Griffon (~7,500 gp, trained adult 10,500gp): The ultimate mount that says "I can afford to spend more on my horse than you do on your mansion". Griffons bond with a single rider for life, so while an adventurer could purchase one, it might take several years of game-time to raise it from an egg so that it's ready to accompany them in an adventure. For some games with certain downtime rules that might be doable, others not so much.

Griffon eggs are worth 3,500 gp apiece on the open market, while young are worth 7,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a griffon.

Magebred Pseudodragon (~1,200 gp): An incredible status symbol for anyone with taste and a tolerance for cleaning dragon droppings off the upholstery, but these colorful and mesmerizing creatures reach their fullest potential when raised by a mage as a familiar. Vadalis magebred pseudodragons can be familiars, casting the *find familiar* spell while holding a willing creature in your arms is enough to make them function as such.

Magebred Ghosttiger (~7,000 gp): King Boranel of Breland doesn’t allow just anyone to hunt in his royal rainforests, but when House Vadalis approached him about creating magebred animals, he allowed the house to take a dozen ghost tigers from the King’s Forest east of Sharn. Within a year, representatives of the dragonmarked house returned with two baby magebred ghost tiger siblings and bestowed them to Breland’s king as a gift. Boranel instantly fell in love with the animals and spent several years populating his rainforests with them. Boranel has decreed that killing magebred ghost tigers in the King’s Forest is a crime punishable by incarceration or death. These great cats get their name from their white stripes and eerie silence. They stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet long. They weigh between 500 and 700 pounds.

Magebred Swarm of Quippers (300 gp): Beautiful, exotic pets to complement any noble's entertaining chamber when placed behind Cannith-forged aquarium glass. Also, you can feed your incompetent minions to them when you need to make a point, or lower any meddlesome do-gooders into them with an unnecessarily slow dipping mechanism (sold separately).

Magebred Hourglass Spiders (25 gp): Keeping these beautiful creatures isn't the sort of thing you can brag about to all your friends, and it's not for the kind of person who often forgets to close doors behind them. For the...enthusiast, however, the rewards are worth the work. By making a DC 15 Animal Handling check, one can harvest enough venom from an hourglass spider for a single dose of DC 13 (2d4 poison damage) poison. A failure on the check results in the Spider making a single attack roll on the person doing the harvesting.

Magebred Mammoth (~2,500 gp): Magebred mammoths are not as massive as those found in the wild, and they have been selectively bred to lack tusks and so have no gore attack. However, they have more docile temperaments which makes them perfectly suited for heavy, repetitive work that would break the back of even a powerful draft horse.

Magebred Giant Wallclimber (~400 gp, trained adult 900 gp): A giant lizard with the Spider Climb ability, essentially a huge gecko that can be ridden. Originally used as pack animals and mounts by Brelish troops in certain tricky mountain passes, since adopted by many military forces in similar areas and recently by merchants and adventurers who frequent areas with otherwise impassable terrain.

Magebred Fire Beetles (5 gp): Kept in a bottle, these beetles need only be fed crickets and they will provide light at night or in dark places. Keep several in a bottle, and they will even breed to replace themselves. If left with holes, moths and other insects will flock to the beetles on their own accord, keeping them happily fed. Used in some noble estates for otherwordly, exotic lighting for gardens and other outdoor places.
